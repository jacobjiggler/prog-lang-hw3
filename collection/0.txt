briton freed after iraq kidnap ordeal arrives home
london jan afp
briton freed this week after being kidnapped in iraq in flew home friday
for reunion with his family officials said as controversy over his ordeal
refused to die down
peter moore computer expert was released unharmed wednesday after two
and half years captivity during which all four of his bodyguards also
britons are thought to have been killed
the year old flight touched down at the royal air force raf base at brize
norton in oxfordshire northwest of london shortly after pm gmt
spokesman for the foreign office in london said
moore who flew from baghdad via amman in jordan was met by officials before
being driven to be reunited with his family off base
his father graeme moore said he was absolutely delighted at his return
saying want to give him big hug when see him me and his friends can
wait to see him and it just massive relief to get him home
moore step parents fran and pauline sweeney appealed for privacy
we are thrilled to have peter back safely we have lot of catching up to do
and would like to have time with peter on our own they said
moore is reportedly going to be sent to safe house for assessments by doctors
and psychiatrists and help in readjusting to normal life
following his release the bbc quoted him as saying he had been subjected to
rough treatment while in captivity but he had been well treated in the final
six months including being given access to television and playstation
relatives of moore and of the guards captured with him have meanwhile spoken of
their anger at the british government handling of the matter
the bodies of three bodyguards alec maclachlan jason swindlehurst
and jason creswell were handed over to british officials last year
fourth alan mcmenemy is also believed to be dead
mcmenemy father dennis accused the foreign office of deceit lies and cover
up while moore mother avril sweeney said the government had never told the
truth the guardian reported
the paper said thursday that iran revolutionary guard led the kidnap operation
and took the five to iran within day of their abduction
general david petraeus the us regional military commander reiterated to
reporters in baghdad friday that moore spent at the very least part of his
time in captivity in iran
that is based on an intelligence assessment and obviously ve not had chance
to hear it certainly not to talk to him but nor to hear anything that he has
said petraeus said
some commentators said deal may have been done to free moore after qais al
khazali leader of the group which captured the britons from government
building in baghdad was recently transferred from us to iraqi custody
graeme moore said he believed this is what had happened
about four weeks ago got tip that there had been secret meetings between
the kidnappers and the americans regarding al khazali he said without
revealing his source
couldn find out any more progress of the meetings as it was all being kept
hush hush the whole thing was kept very secret to stop the foreign office
messing it up
the foreign office denied any deal was done saying the united states
transferred al khazali into iraqi custody under the terms of bilateral status
of forces agreement
separately the government of iraq is carrying out process of reconciliation
with groups willing to renounce violence and enter the political mainstream it
said in statement
since holding hostages is incompatible with reconciliation we judge that
progress on the wider reconciliation effort will benefit hostages held in iraq
there has been no prisoner exchange deal in the case of peter moore
britain and iran have also played down reports of link to iran
