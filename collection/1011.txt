badly coordinated with other states and agencies efforts and had been too
heavy handed in the immediate chaotic aftermath of the quake

the leadership of our president in trying to respond to historically disastrous
conditions after the earthquake clinton said in washington
some us troops have been sent to haiti to distribute food and water
the international relief effort has been hampered by traffic congestion and
lingering security fears and has yet to get enough aid into the capital port

going to be more than years of efforts
haitians who lived with decades of political upheaval and bloodshed fear the
new found international interest in their plight could soon fade
top officer said the us military could start rolling back its relief operation
in haiti within three to six months if international organizations are able to
take on larger role
think there commitment to continue to provide support and stay engaged
until other organizations can take over the role said vice admiral alan

jobless recovery is the political priority of today said ilo director general

the hong kong born poet collection scattering beat the frontrunner irish
author colm toibin to pick up the prestigious pound euro
dollar costa book of the year award
it will come as shock to the literary world and blow to toibin who had been
firm favourite to scoop the prize for his novel brooklyn
sixty year old reid took inspiration for his collection of poems from the death
of his wife actress lucinda gane from cancer in
delighted and bewildered to be the recipient of this important literary
prize he said after winning the award at london ceremony
the book itself was difficult to write but it had very happy time since it
fell into the hands of my publisher and has been on number of shortlists
for prizes
irish novelist josephine hart who chaired the judging panel hailed his
collection master work as she announced it had won
we feel that what christopher reid did was to take personal tragedy and to
make the emotion and the situation universal she said
we regard this work as austere and beautiful and moving
the work is comprised of four poetic sequences with the first written during
his wife final illness and the remaining three at intervals following her
death
reid who has held the post of professor of creative writing at britain
university of hull was nominated for two costa awards previously and this was

football spurs steal march on goalless liverpool
london jan afp
tottenham retained their place in the premier league top four with win
over fulham on tuesday as liverpool hopes of securing return to the
champions league next season suffered another setback
despite the return of club captain steven gerrard from injury rafael benitez
men were listless in goalless stalemate at struggling wolves
but the liverpool manager was defiantly upbeat after result that means his
side are unbeaten in five matches in the league
we had two or three chances in the first half and it was same in the second but
our final pass not the best the spaniard said
but it it is another clean sheet and everyone is working really hard so
think it is really positive
the draw leaves liverpool three points adrift of fourth placed tottenham who
were always in control of their london derby clash with fulham at white hart
lane
three points that was the main thing tonight but think the win was well
deserved tonight said spurs boss harry redknapp
spurs went ahead mid way through the first half through peter crouch who fired
home after being teed up by luka modric following wonderful piece of
improvisation from the croatia playmaker
david bentley made sure of the win with second half free kick that found the
net with the help of deflection off bjorn helge riise which wrong footed
fulham australian goalkeeper mark schwarzer
at the other end of the table it was memorable night for bolton who claimed
their first league win under new manager owen coyle at the expense of his
former club burnley
lee chung yong th minute strike proved enough to earn bolton win that
lifted them out of the relegation zone
as result of west ham and wolves both picking up point apiece burnley
dropped into the drop zone for the first time this season
predictably coyle was given hostile reception from the visiting fans who
hurled judas insults at the man they used to refer to as god
more appropriate biblical reference coyle wryly reminded his critics would
be moses given his achievement in leading burnley to the promised land of the
premier league
west ham had to settle for draw at bottom club portsmouth after taking the
lead at fratton park
the hammers had gone ahead seven minutes into the second half alessandro
diamanti curled corner from the right towards the back post and after it had
been deflected goalwards by pompey defender younes kaboul the ball ended up in
the net off the thigh of matthew upson
the hammers looked strong favourites to go on and take all three points at that
stage but portsmouth snatched an equaliser with just under quarter of an hour
left
john utaka played in danny webber and the substitute slotted his finish through
the legs of hammers goalkeeper robert green for his first premier league goal

travolta flies aid scientology to haiti
port au prince jan afp
hollywood movie star john travolta flew plane load of aid to haiti along with
group of ministers from the church of scientology who performed tuesday
healing rituals on quake survivors
travolta along with tom cruise is one of the leading proponents of
scientology which some countries treat as controversial faith but others say
is cult that tricks vulnerable members out of large sums of money
the pulp fiction star joined on the trip by his wife kelly preston flew back
to the united states after the drop off from miami to port au prince late
monday
the plane which travolta flew himself resupplied the church of scientology
effort in haiti with some four tons of food aid and medical supplies and brought
along over more of the faith young enthusiastic followers
the scientologists handed out water and medical equipment at the capital main
hospital and trained young haitians to perform their touch assist technique
that they claim can reconnect damaged nervous systems
travolta did similar aid run in after hurricane katrina slammed the us
gulf coast destroying tens of thousands of homes and killing nearly
people
wearing bright yellow shirts with the us based group logo on the front and
the slogan something can be done about it on the back some volunteers
out of about members in the country were at the overcrowded hospital
teaming with dozens of aid agencies treating thousands of injured haitians
we fill holes we re there where people need us gushed perky year old
coordinator ellen bennett
after arriving on the ground two days after the killer january earthquake
practically leveled haiti largest city the group is camped out by the
airport where they unload aid for other agencies and send their own supplies to
hospitals in the city and at least six surrounding towns bennett said
and if people need hug then we give them that too she smiled
bed ridden earthquake victims looked on in helpless bemusement under makeshift
canvas shelter in the hospital courtyard as followers did their rounds of
touch assists
number of young haitian men desperate for work and food were being taught
the technique by volunteers and were encouraged to make touching rounds
themselves
carol delva suffered crushed knee when her house collapsed on her and
lay inert on damp sheets in the courtyard while la based scientologist dave
mcgregor touched her feet legs and torso thanking her with merci after
each poke
claudal henry port au prince native had been under dave wing since
saturday and was now teaching the technique to other haitians
step by step day by day people feel better yes it works he told afp
delva eight year old son was instructed to try out the method but mcgregor
followed by henry shook their heads when he failed to understand
he clearly still traumatized by what happened said mcgregor
sympathetically
other aid agencies and doctors at the hospital were reluctant to criticize the
group as they supplied them with medicine drinking water and sanitized water
for operations and didn appear to openly proselytize the stranger aspects
of their faith in return
founded in by us science fiction writer ron hubbard the church of
scientology is recognized as religion in the united states and claims
worldwide membership of million
its teachings involve alien interventions in world history among many other
tales reportedly including the galactic ruler xenu who brought first humans
to earth million years ago
the faith is banned in france for defrauding members while officials in
germany greece russia and elsewhere accuse it of tricking members out of large
amounts of money
new york radiologist alan greenfield however spoke in glowing terms about the
new volunteers especially after the scientologists flew in an ray machine
that has enabled him to examine desperate patients with crushed limbs and broken
bones
the church has been fabulous with logistics they ve been very supportive he
told afp if doctors need water they get water if someone needs blood
pressure pump they find one and bring it

us looks to un for new airline security standards
washington jan afp
the united states is looking to low profile un agency to help set tough new
global airline security standards homeland security secretary janet napolitano
and officials said tuesday
chastened by christmas day plot to blow up trans atlantic passenger jet
napolitano said the us was looking to the international civil aviation
organization to rally countries toward new minimum security requirements
following meeting with european union and airline industry representatives
last week napolitano said there was now clear sense of urgency to take
immediate action to strengthen security measures
napolitano said the icao had backed series of regional meetings to discuss new
rules but did not go further
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the icao could provide
new global rules with one source expressing hope that legislation could start
to take shape by the middle of the year
napolitano did not go into detail about the measures but has previously called
for enhanced random screening more federal air marshals on flights destined for
the united states and an expanded terrorist watchlist
the secretary who struck tough new tone tuesday after being lambasted for
public comments in the wake of the christmas day attack said there was now
renewed commitment from partners to overhaul security measures
the european union and united states have long sparred over airline security
with brussels and other european capitals expressing concern that passenger
screening may endanger privacy and that trade could be hit by overly onerous
legislation
during meeting last week in spain napolitano tried to convince eu officials
to approve the installation of body scanners at the bloc main airports for
use by us bound passengers
napolitano said the machines would now be seen at airports in london amsterdam
frankfurt and paris
the us is also pressing for quicker transfer of passenger information as it
tries to address some of the intelligence failings of the christmas day attack
when young nigerian smuggled high explosives onto the plane bound from
amsterdam to detroit
it has since emerged that the man father had warned the us embassy in abuja
about his son contact with radical islam
the disclosure led year old umar farouk abdulmutallab to appear on what is
known as list of possible terrorists designation that was not
enough to place him on no fly list
it also emerged that abdulmutallab had been denied visa to visit britain but
that information was not used by airline authorities either
napolitano said that would change over the coming year as the department of
homeland security also looks to deploy new technology and more law enforcement
and canine resources to boost airline security
football webber keeps portsmouth fighting
london jan afp
danny webber came off the bench to claim his first premier league goal as
portsmouth avoided what would have been morale sapping defeat to fellow
strugglers west ham at fratton park
the hammers were on track for much needed three points after taking the lead
with scrappy effort from club captain matthew upson seven minutes into the
second half
but webber th minute goal reduced the damage suffered by avram grant side
who nevertheless remain bottom of the table four points adrift of the side
above them hull and five away from safety
west ham had taken the lead following an inswinging cross from alessandro
diamanti which found its way into the net off upson after younes kaboul who
was initially credited with an own goal had appeared to make contact
portsmouth should have equalised when mark wilson sent free header wide ten
minutes later and the home fans were finally rewarded for their patience two
mintues after webber came off the bench
the former manchester united trainee was played in by john utaka and he beat the
advancing robert green with low shot that slipped through the keeper legs
webber nearly snatched winner when he flicked utaka cross from the left just
over the bar but draw was just about the right result after an opening period
that had been tale of two goalkeepers with pompey asmir begovic and green
both excelling
portsmouth who had learned earlier in the day that they will be allowed to
acquire new players on free transfers or loan deals before the end of the
transfer window were without injured midfield duo papa bouba diop and michael
brown
the hammers meanwhile were boosted by the sight of england striker carlton cole
taking his place on the bench following his recovery from knee injury
portsmouth enjoyed the first real chance frederic piquionne narrowly failing to
connect with hermann hreidarsson ball across the goalmouth
but they had begovic to thank for keeping them level the serb throwing himself
to his left to keep out frank nouble strike before turning away valon
behrami shot on the follow up
portsmouth responded immediately and green had to pull off full length save to
keep out utaka strike shortly before the west ham back four managed to
scramble kaboul volley off the goalline
the momentum swung back towards the visitors with jack collison played through
by nouble producing another good stop from begovic to ensure the match remained
goalless at the interval
