washington jan afp
the us senate voted tuesday to reject the creation of special task force

lawmakers turned aside the proposal which would have given the commission the
job of making politically difficult fat trimming recommendations to the us
congress by vote margin with one senator not casting ballot
the measure which needed votes to pass would have been attached to
legislation raising the us debt ceiling by trillion dollars to
trillion dollars
that initiative faces considerable opposition from president barack obama
republican foes but is expected to pass

spyker ceo vows to maintain iconic brand saab
stockholm jan afp
spyker cars ceo victor muller told reporters tuesday his newly purchased swedish
carmaker saab would need to learn to stand on its own feet vowing to keep the
iconic brand afloat amid crisis in the car industry
it been an incredible ride since we started the negotiations back in
november muller told press conference in stockholm shortly after general
motors announced binding agreement to sell its high end saab division to
muller spyker cars
the first thing that needs to happen is that saab needs to learn to stand on
its own feet it been part of very large conglomerate for very long and it
going to be quite challenging to be absolutely responsible for everything
yourself he said
as part of the sales agreement spyker will form new company saab spyker
automobiles which will carry the saab nameplate forward
that company will in the future have two operating companies under the same
roof that will be independent but working very closely together muller said
it not so that spyker will benefit immediately from being sister company to
saab or vice versa he warned however praising gm for creating an
infrastructure and business that is serious as can be in its year
ownership of the swedish brand
muller vowed to keep the identity of saab and praised the network of dealers and
brand enthusiasts who were quick to show their support for the brand gm said on
december it would wind down
the interest in saab is basically very easy to understand saab is an iconic
brand muller said the typical element of the saab brand is its
swedishness think one would be very short sighted to think that the saab
buyer would be very please to buy saab from mumbai he added
muller said his current business plan for saab did not foresee important job
cuts but did insist that the road ahead for the car industry was unpredictable
no industry was hit harder than the car industry assuming that everything
develops according to plan we will be good in terms of our staff he said
football spurs steal march on goalless liverpool
london jan afp
tottenham retained their place in the premier league top four with win
over fulham on tuesday as liverpool hopes of securing return to the
champions league next season suffered another setback
despite the return of club captain steven gerrard from injury rafael benitez
men were listless in goalless stalemate at struggling wolves
the draw leaves liverpool three points adrift of fourth placed tottenham who
were always in control of their london derby clash with fulham at white hart
lane
harry redknapp side went ahead mid way through the first half through peter
crouch who fired home after being teed up by luka modric following wonderful
piece of improvisation from the croatia playmaker
david bentley made sure of the win with second half free kick that found the
net with the help of deflection off bjorn helge riise which wrong footed
fulham australian goalkeeper mark schwarzer
at the other end of the table it was memorable night for bolton who claimed
their first league win under new manager owen coyle at the expense of his
former club burnley
lee chung yong th minute strike proved enough to earn bolton win that
lifted them out of the relegation zone
as result of west ham and wolves both picking up point apiece burnley
dropped into the drop zone for the first time this season
west ham had to settle for draw at bottom club portsmouth after taking the
lead at fratton park
the hammers had gone ahead seven minutes into the second half alessandro
diamanti curled corner from the right towards the back post and after it had
been deflected goalwards by pompey defender younes kaboul the ball ended up in
the net off the thigh of matthew upson
the hammers looked strong favourites to go on and take all three points at that
stage but portsmouth snatched an equaliser with just under quarter of an hour
left
john utaka played in danny webber and the substitute slotted his finish through
the legs of hammers goalkeeper robert green for his first premier league goal

hard labor for haiti mothers
port au prince jan afp
when the screams of women giving birth die down you can hear the subdued cries
of those babies who made it alive into the chaotic post quake suffering of port
au prince general hospital
the women lie atop mattresses on gravel in the sweltering heat of tents erected
in the hospital courtyard some have limbs amputated others pelvic fractures
in haiti the joy of parenthood must wait sometimes forever
women give birth after being pulled from the rubble their legs or arms
amputated some have deep wounds jean herby lafrance cuban trained haitian
doctor who flew in with group of cuban medics last week told afp
before the january quake thought to have killed people the
impoverished caribbean nation had the highest rate of maternal mortality in the
western hemisphere deaths per births
fifteen percent of births involved hemorrhaging or other complications requiring
operations according to the united nations population fund unfpa with an
estimated pregnant women among haiti affected population
doctors nurses and mothers alike labored long parents cradled newborns in
their arms some nursed most faces were expressionless stuck between awe at
the destruction and the joy of survival others smiled in spite of it all
so far lafrance had delivered babies including five by cesarean section and
two premature births brought on by stress from the earthquake
we ve had eight women miscarry some three or four months pregnant said the
year old who has two children of his own at home in santiago de cuba
we have problems with equipment particularly for cesareans said lafrance
the situation for operations is very critical we don have the material but
we operate anyway it very difficult
he said there were no doctors in maternity when he arrived today with
volunteers from around the world in haiti he said there were enough doctors
but almost everything else was lacking
we have nothing to prepare the women no compresses sometimes no anesthetic
and the operating tables are incomplete we need material
some women can make it to hospital and give birth without assistance in the
many makeshift camps that have sprung up in and around port au prince
conditions beyond the capital can be much worse
around women are expected to give birth in affected areas over the next
month with another expected miscarriages the unfpa jemilah mahmood
told afp
the unfpa is trying to get basic reproductive health kits containing plastic
sheet sterile blade to cut the umbilical cord and clean string to tie it
plus blanket for the newborn to pregnant women in haiti
midwives and health centers when they see someone who is visibly pregnant and
about to give birth they hand this out to them so that if they deliver in the
middle of the street they have clean delivery kit mahmood said
more advanced kits are being distributed to the hospitals and health centers
that survived the earthquake some contain emergency caesarean section
equipment others things ranging from kidney dishes to gloves
but while the kits might be step towards providing slightly more sanitary
conditions to women as they give birth they do nothing to preserve something
else that was also taken from haitian women and girls by the quake dignity
joane kerez gave birth to her first child week and day after the quake
struck in the middle of square in port au prince where thousands of displaced
haitians have made their homes care worker wrote on the ngo website
kerez had only tarpaulin for privacy her mother to help her through labor
and crowd of onlookers gawking as she brought her baby into the world
would have rather been somewhere else in cleaner place without all those
people looking at my body kerez said
one of the things that is talked about very little is dignity said mahmood
explaining that unfpa has begun distributing dignity kits to haitian women
the kits contain sanitary towels hygiene materials underwear
women and girls are still menstruating in spite of living outside in very
horrible conditions and having your clothes soiled could mean you are unable to
get to food or water distribution points and that can really impede survival
and recovery said mahmood
put yourself in the same position going to supermarket and your clothes
are soiled by menstrual blood she told reporters on teleconference in the
united states
