formula one paris court overturns briatore ban
paris jan afp
paris court on tuesday ruled in favour of former renault boss flavio briatore
overturning lifetime suspension from motor sports imposed by formula one
governing body fia
the high court ruled the sanction illegal citing irregularities in fia
decision in september to ban briatore for allegedly ordering nelson piquet
junior to crash at the singapore grand prix
the scandal centred on driver piquet junior claims that the team had ordered
him to crash deliberately at singapore to enable teammate fernando alonso to go
on and win
briatore had fiercely denied any involvement in the scheme dubbed crashgate
the court said it judged irregular the september decision of the world
council of the fia regarding its rulings concerning messrs briatore and
symonds
clearly this is an exceptional result for my client we have obtained
practically everything we asked for said briatore lawyer philippe ouakrat
ouakrat had in his submissions to the court in november queried the
discretionary power of the fia to ban briatore
the fia must withdraw its decision as it is an illegal order both in its
results and in the manner in which it has been elaborated said ouakrat
the court duly found that the fia had overreached itself in handing down the
ban
ouakrat said he was unaware if briatore who did not attend the court hearing
would seek to return to an active role in formula one where he has produced
championship winning performances with both benetton and renault
the court found that even if the fia were able to sanction officials in the
sport it cannot take with regard to third parties measures tantamount to
sanctions
for ouakrat briatore did not wish to see imposed upon him completely
scandalous decision decision in his absence and without his being able to
defend himself
this decision will mark motor sport and think it will also influence to
great degree the way justice is served in the world council added ouakrat who
noted the poor relationship between briatore and former fia president max
mosley
the court noted that the decision to discipline briatore came while the council
was chaired by mosley who was known to have been in conflict with mr
briatore it said
jean fran ois prat the fia counsel said that our client will most likely
appeal tuesday verdict
briatore had insisted that the punishment he received last september from motor
sport governing body the fia had no legal basis
the world motor sport council had found renault breached its sporting code
adding the affair comprised conduct of unparalleled severity
the paris court awarded briatore who had been seeking million euros in
damages from the fia mere euros while former renault technical
director pat symonds who had been handed five year ban also had the
suspension overturned
symonds had sought euros in damages but received just euros
the court also called on the fia to notify its members of tuesday judgment
within days or face daily euro penalty
representatives of symonds and briatore insisted that the procedures followed in
the investigation into crashgate contravened the fia international sporting
code
the fia did not take action against piquet after he blew the lid on the affair
colombian madoff is extradited to us
bogota jan afp

multi million dollar pyramid scheme was extradited tuesday to the united states
to face money laundering charges police said
david murcia who is accused of swindling investors out of staggering
million dollars was sent in an aircraft belonging to the us drug enforcement
administration at gmt from military airfield they said
david murcia guzman was handed over early today tuesday by jail officials to
the national police and we at this moment are delivering him to us

murcia the owner of company called dmg had been sought for money laundering
in both panama and the united states
he was captured in panama in november and deported to colombia where he was
sentenced to years in jail for illegally raising funds and money laundering

percent per investment thousands of colombians gave it go and lost all of
their savings sparking widespread outrage

traffickers

britain to launch new scanners in three weeks minister
london jan afp
britain will introduce its first full body scanners at london heathrow airport
in about three weeks time in the wake of the failed detroit plane bombing
minister said tuesday
airports will also be ordered to increase the proportion of people they search
by hand and whose baggage they test for traces of explosives while there will
be more sniffer dogs home secretary alan johnson added
it is clear that no one measure will be enough to defeat inventive and
determined terrorists and there is no single technology which we can guarantee
will be per cent effective against such attacks johnson told lawmakers
detailing new measures agreed following the december failed attack he said
the first full body scanners will be deployed in around three weeks at heathrow
over time they will be introduced more widely
we will be requiring all uk airports to introduce explosive trace detection
equipment by the end of the year he added
he acknowledged that there may be some additional delays as airports adapt
but added am sure the travelling public will appreciate the reasons behind
this
he also sought to allay fears that the new scanners would break laws against
creating indecent images of children
privacy campaigners told the guardian that the images created by the machines
were so graphic they amounted to virtual strip searching and have called for
safeguards to protect the privacy of passengers involved
terri dowty of civil rights group action on rights for children said the
scanners could breach child protection laws which made it illegal to create an
indecent image or pseudo image of child
they do not have the legal power to use full body scanners in this way she
told the newspaper
but johnson told the house of commons we are discussing urgently with the
airport industry the best way of doing all this which will include code of
practice dealing with operational and privacy issues
some countries led by the united states have announced additional security
measures at airports since nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab was charged with
trying to blow up us bound jet on christmas day
abdulmutallab reportedly confessed to being trained by an al qaeda
bombmaker in yemen for the suicide mission on the northwest airlines flight from
amsterdam to detroit
it was foiled when explosives sewn into the man underwear failed to detonate
and passengers jumped on him
jordan says no proof balawi was cia suicide bomber
amman jan afp
senior jordanian official said on tuesday there was no proof that jordanian
humam khalil abu mulal al balawi was as has been claimed the suicide bomber
who killed eight people at cia base in afghanistan
there is no proof that humam was actually the author of the attack especially
given that taliban websites claim that it was an afghan said the official who
declined to be identified
he added that balawi had provided jordanian intelligence with valuable
information but did not say whether he was still alive
when the media mentioned the name hummam khalil al balawi we inquired about
his identity and we can confirm that he is indeed jordanian but we cannot
confirm that he was the author of the attack said the official
earlier jihadist websites said balawi was triple agent who duped western
intelligence services for months before turning on his handlers
the jordanian intelligence services believing the bomber to be their double
agent took him to eastern afghanistan with the mission of finding al qaeda
number two ayman al zawahiri the websites and western intelligence agents
cited by us media said
but instead he blew himself up at forward operating base chapman in khost
province near the pakistani border killing seven cia agents and his jordanian
handler top intelligence officer and member of the royal family
the jordanian official said balawi had been interrogated by intelligence
officers around year ago because of suspicions about his activities but the
probe found nothing and he was freed
humam left jordan and traveled to pakistan to continue medical studies that he
had begun in turkey from pakistan he contacted the jordanian authorities by
mail and provided security information of extreme value that allowed us to
abort terrorist operations that would have threatened the security of jordan
he added that contact had been maintained with balawi in the interest of the
security of jordan

some million german bank cards hit by bug banks
frankfurt jan afp
around million high tech german bank cards could leave owners high and dry
bank associations warned tuesday as the feared computer bug cropped up
years later than expected
the problem that hit cardholders trying to use cash machines or make payments
throughout germany and abroad stems from computer chips unable to recognise the
year and could take up to week to resolve the dsgv savings and regional
banking association said in statement
global alert had gone out years ago amid widespread fears of similar
problem dubbed for the year
more recent cards that contain computer chip designed to provide extra
security have been affected while older ones with just magnetic strip on the
back appear to work normally
dsgv said around million electronic cash ec cards also known as
girocards and million classic credit cards issued by its members had been
affected
ec cards are direct debit instruments which do not allow owners to buy on
credit
the private bank association bdb said some million of its cards had been
hit and the bvr association added that four million cards issued by germany
cooperative banks had also been partially touched by the problem
around million ec cards currently circulate in germany where cash is also
widely used form of payment
among the country private banks commerzbank spokeswoman said just some of
its cards had been affected and that many of its machines had already been
adapted to accept those in question but did not provide detailed figures
postbank which has the biggest retail banking network in germany declined to
say to what extent it had been hit
deutsche bank clients do not have problem spokeswoman for the biggest
german bank told afp
dsgv said that the bug which it termed delayed year problem should be
completely eliminated by next monday but that withdrawal restrictions on
some credit cards were still possible until then
the use of ec cards and not credit cards is recommended at cash machines until
further notice the dsgv said adding that it was working intensively to
resolve the problem
around of its machines have been repaired dsgv said but roughly one
third of all payment terminals in the country were reportedly still affected on
tuesday
german stores are equipped with around such terminals
payment problems were also reported meanwhile by germans who were on holiday
outside the country
europe took its latest step towards harmonised electronic payment system in
november with the single euro payments area sepa direct debit network that
