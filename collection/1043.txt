zambia ex leader chiluba supports banda for polls
lusaka jan afp
zambia former leader frederick chiluba has endorsed president rupiah banda for
re election next year state media said tuesday in the latest sign of his
renewed embrace of the party he once led
let give president banda chance by voting for him chiluba told rally in
ndola the main city in the country copperbelt according to the zambia daily
mail
chiluba led zambia from to with his hand picked successor levy
mwanawasa then taking the helm of their movement for multiparty democracy mmd
and succeeding him in office
but mwanawasa quickly turned against chiluba bringing him up on charges of
embezzling dollars in state funds in case that was dismissed last
year
mwanawasa died before the conclusion of the case since year old banda took
office he has quashed efforts to appeal chiluba acquittal and dismantled the
team that led the prosecution
chiluba still faces separate graft case in lusaka stemming from
conviction in britain where court found him and former aides guilty of
stealing nearly million dollars of state funds
chiluba insisted there was nothing wrong with him again switching his political
allegiances
in the same manner that supported michael sata in am now supporting
the candidature of president banda the paper quotes chiluba as saying
if we vote for michael sata and hakainde hichilema leader of the smaller
united party for national development they will destroy the nation because
they don have the heart for the country he added
hong kong lawmakers resign in democracy push
hong kong jan afp
five pro democracy lawmakers in hong kong resigned their seats tuesday vowing
to turn the resulting elections into populist referendum for universal
suffrage in defiance of warnings from china
about onlookers with similar number of press in attendance applauded
under leaden skies as the lawmakers staged the most high profile challenge yet
to communist china stewardship of the glitzy financial hub
three members of the league of social democrats and two from the civic party
tendered their resignations at the legislative council toothless body in
british colonial times that critics say remains rubber stamp under beijing
we are giving the opportunity back to the people to vote for real democracy
civic party leader audrey eu said after her two colleagues quit
so we call on the people if you truly believe in democracy there is no reason
to fear
two days before their resignations take effect on friday the lawmakers plan to
outline their goals at what promises to be stormy legislative council session
on wednesday as they face off against pro beijing forces
chief executive donald tsang said the government deeply regrets the lawmakers
resignations and that their referendum had no legal basis but he said the
government was under statutory duty to organise by elections
as the chief executive did not wish to see the situation we have arrived at
today but we have the responsibility to hold the by election in accordance with
the election ordinance he said in statement
only half of hong kong seat legislature is directly elected from five
geographical constituencies the remaining functional constituency seats are
largely selected by pro china business elites
an member election committee picked by beijing chooses the city chief
executive job that replaced the post of governor when britain returned hong
kong to chinese rule in
democrats are calling for universal suffrage in but the chinese government
has said hong kong chief executive can only be directly elected at the
earliest by and the legislature by
two weeks ago beijing issued statement expressing gave concern over the
dissident lawmakers plan and saying hong kong had no right to hold popular
plebiscites
civic party member tanya chan one of the five lawmakers who resigned dismissed
claims by pro beijing political parties that democrats were calling for
violent uprising
it rational and peaceful pursuit for real democracy she said
constitutional reform can only take place with the approval of two thirds of
hong kong legislature meaning the democrats who hold seats are unlikely
to be able to force their agenda on policymakers
and the democrats latest campaign faces potential setback after the liberal
party major pro beijing faction announced last week it would not take part
in any by elections
another pro beijing party the democratic alliance for the betterment and
progress of hong kong was to decide whether to contest the by elections in
meeting late tuesday
political observers say china is leaning on the pro beijing parties to shun the
by elections
by pressuring those political parties to boycott the by election beijing hopes
to trivialise the event and discourage people from casting their vote said
ivan choy political analyst at chinese university of hong kong
an opinion poll conducted by the university of hong kong on january said
that just percent of the respondents supported universal suffrage
compared to percent who said they were against
but thousands of people took to the streets on new year day to call for full
democracy and the release of prominent jailed chinese dissident liu xiaobo
pro democrats were outraged last week by news that zhou yongjun leader of the
tiananmen protests in beijing had been jailed for nine years for fraud
after authorities in hong kong handed him over to china
