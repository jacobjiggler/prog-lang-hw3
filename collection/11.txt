supporters which saw hundreds of people arrested during the demonstrations
he urged the government to take responsibility for the problems it has created
in the country release political prisoners and recognise people right to
lawful assembly
say openly that until there is an acknowledgement of the existence of
serious crisis in the country there will be no possibility of resolving the
problems and issues he said
the former prime minister rejected demands from hardliners for him to renounce
his accusations of fraud in the june election in which he was ahmadinejad main
challenger
clearly and explicitly say that the order to execute kill or jail former
parliament speaker and pro reform presidential candidate mehdi karroubi
mousavi and people like us will not solve anything
supposedly you calmed things down through your arrests violence threats and
closure of newspapers and other media what appreciation does that show for the
change in public opinion about the islamic republic
mousavi rejected charges by ahmadinejad and other officials that he and his
supporters were lackeys of iran western foes
we are neither americans nor britons we have sent no congratulations cards to
the leaders of major powers he said in mocking allusion to card the iranian
president sent to barack obama on his election as us president in
we are loyal to the constitution he added dismissing accusations by
hardliners that the opposition protests against ahmadinejad re election have
turned into campaign to topple the islamic regime
we want an honest and compassionate government that considers diversity of
opinion and the popular vote to be opportunities not threats
we consider invasion of people privacy interrogations ransackings
newspaper closures and restrictions on what is published to be violations of the
constitution
mousavi demanded in particular that the authorities end their interference with
internet services in iran which have been the main conduit for the opposition
to spread news of its protests and arrests of its leaders
the website denied reports by state media that the opposition leader had fled
the capital tehran for the northern province of mazandaran on the caspian sea
coast
mir hossein mousavi is at his own home in one of the side alleys of pasteur
avenue in south tehran like before and has not left tehran at all in the past
few days his kaleme org website said
despite the very recent arrest of his senior advisers mir hossein mousavi is
seriously following up political developments and news it added
hardline cleric ahmad janati meanwhile reiterated call for opposition
protesters to be swiftly put on trial and face the ultimate sanction
these are obvious examples of corrupt on the earth he said referring to
charge that is punishable by death under islamic law
the judiciary must allocate more judges to this revolutionary judges not
weak ones

somalia shebab says will send fighters to yemen
mogadishu jan afp
somalia hardline shebab insurgents friday said they will send fighters to
yemen to help an al qaeda affiliate behind the failed christmas day jetliner
bombing in its fight against government forces
sheikh mukhtar robow abu mansour senior official of the shebab militia that
pledges allegiance to al qaeda announced the plan as he presented hundreds of
newly trained fighters in the north of mogadishu
we tell our muslim brothers in yemen that we will cross the water between us
and reach your place to assist you fight the enemy of allah said robow to
chants of allahu akbar or allah is great by the young fighters
today you see what is happening in yemen the enemy of allah is destroying your
muslim brothers he added
call upon the young men in arab lands to join the fight there
yemeni forces have been battling al qaeda militants in the country and last
month launched raids on suspected targets in the central and the sanaa regions
killing more than islamist militants
several others were also wounded in clashes this week in western province of
the impoverished arabian peninsula state which lies north of somalia across the
gulf of aden
yemen is al qaeda leader osama bin laden ancestral homeland and has seen
spate of attacks against western targets over the past decade
an al qaeda affiliate based in yemen claimed it was behind the botched christmas
day plot to bring down us jetliner from amsterdam to detroit
sanaa acknowledged that the nigerian citizen accused by the united states of
attempting to blow up the northwest airlines plane had been in the country just
weeks before the foiled bombing
umar farouk abdulmutallab who allegedly tried to blow up the plane is
suspected of receiving training for his mission from an al qaeda bomb maker in
yemen
on thursday somalia police chief said man had been arrested in november at
mogadishu airport with chemicals and syringe in similar incident to the
failed attack on the us airliner
the suspect was however released on december by mogadishu court which threw
out case against him for lack of evidence
another police official among those who arrested the unnamed somali man said
further investigation had been launched after the december jetliner incident
the al qaeda inspired shebab control large swathes of south and central somalia
and have wrested control of much of the capital mogadishu where they have
relentlessly attacked government and african union forces
these young fighters successfully completed several months of tough training
and they are now ready to join their brothers in the holy war against the enemy
of allah worldwide robow said
on monday yemeni defence ministry official said the country will never be
refuge for islamist militants and pledged more attacks on their hideouts like
those of december

vatican city jan afp
pope benedict xvi called for respect and tolerance in his traditional new year
day mass friday stressing the values were necessary to ensure world peace and
ecological responsibility
respect others regardless of their skin colour nationality language
religion benedict said even very young it is important to be taught to
respect others even when they are different to us he emphasised
in his homily before the vatican diplomatic corps the pontiff noted that it was
increasingly common for schools to have children from different nationalities in
the classroom
their faces represent the prophecy of humanity that we are invited to develop
family of families and peoples benedict said adding that the other is
brother within humanity not rival nor an enemy
benedict spoke against war and violence deploring that too often the faces of
children were sunken by hunger and illness disfigured by pain and
hopelessness
before these defenceless human beings all the false justifications for war and
violence fall down
benedict appealed for all weapons to be laid down for more dignified world
the pope also stressed ecological awareness reiterating his message made public
in december and to be read in every parish from friday entitled if you want to
cultivate peace preserve what has already been created
the pontiff advocated human ecology saying there is close link between
respect for mankind and respect for nature
if humanity shames itself it damages its environment benedict said
he appealed for investment in education with the objective not only to transmit
technical and scientific concepts but also broader and deeper ecological
responsibility based on respect for humanity human rights and fundamental
duties
