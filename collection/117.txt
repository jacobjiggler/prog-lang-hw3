optimism spurred demand for currencies seen as well placed to benefit from an
economic recovery analysts said

comfortable margin weighing on the greenback

united states on friday that are seen as crucial indicator of the health of
the world largest economy
market players are now trying to factor in forecasts for us payrolls figures to
be released later this week said jitsuo tachibana senior manager in the
foreign exchange division of sumitomo trust bank
many investors are hoping the us economy will finally stop shedding jobs in
december after months of hefty losses
the dollar had ended on an upbeat note in the wake of government data
indicating that new us claims for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level
since july
in london on tuesday the euro was changing hands at dollars against

corrected us embassy in yemen reopens as clinton warns of instability
sanaa jan afp
the us embassy in yemen reopened tuesday after two day closure prompted by al
qaeda threats as us secretary of state hillary clinton warned unrest in the arab
country is threat to global stability
the embassy said on its website that yemeni security forces had addressed
specific area of concern in the north of the capital on monday paving the way
for tuesday reopening
warnings of possible al qaeda attack had led washington to close its embassy
in the yemeni capital on sunday the british and french authorities followed
suit while japan suspended consular services at its embassy
there was no sign on tuesday that the other missions had resumed normal
operations with all three saying they were reviewing the situation
successful counter terrorism operations conducted by the government of yemen
security forces january north of the capital have addressed specific area of
concern and have contributed to the embassy decision to resume operations
the embassy said
the statement appeared to refer to security operation conducted by yemeni
police monday in the area of arhab kilometres miles north of sanaa
where two suspected members of al qaeda were killed and three others wounded
the united states commends the government of yemen for its efforts to disrupt
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap networks and reiterates its commitment
to continue to support these efforts it added
the statement was referring to al qaeda franchise in yemen which claimed
responsibility for the failed attack on us airliner on christmas day and
urged attacks on western interests in the country
the yemen interior ministry said tuesday that all foreign missions and interests
were safe pointing out that it has reinforced security measures around
embassies and residences of foreigners
the ministry also said that it arrested five terrorist elements over the past
two days near the capital but gave no details
long standing concerns that yemen country on the southern tip of the arabian
peninsula has become haven for islamic terror groups were thrown into sharp
relief when nigerian man allegedly trained in yemen was charged with trying to
blow up us bound jet on december
umar farouk abdulmutallab reportedly confessed to being trained by an al
qaeda bombmaker in yemen for the suicide mission on the northwest flight from
amsterdam to detroit
it was foiled when explosives allegedly sewn into the man underwear failed to
detonate and passengers jumped on him
us president barack obama has revealed that abdulmutallab spent time in yemen
during the summer where he was allegedly in contact with aqap
obama was to hold talks tuesday with his intelligence and national security
chiefs on the botched bombing with an administration official telling afp that
obama would unveil an initial series of reforms following the meeting
his secretary of state meanwhile on monday warned that the unrest in yemen was
threat both to regional and even global stability
and certainly we know that this is difficult set of challenges but they
have to be addressed clinton told reporters in washington following talks with
qatari prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassem bin jabr al thani

british charities warn of strain in coming gurkha influx
london jan afp
thousands of veteran gurkha soldiers from nepal may arrive in britain with
almost nothing after winning the right to settle here putting huge strain on
military charities the groups warned tuesday
up to former gurkhas may apply for uk residency in the next three years
and new arrivals will typically need charities to provide them with money and
accommodation according to the army benevolent fund
they will arrive from an aircraft they ll probably have two suitcases and no
more they re going to need everything to set up home the charity director
of welfare paul cummings told the bbc
it was an issue of grave concern that some of those arriving seemed to be so
ill prepared for life in britain he said
dozen families had already approached his charity in the two weeks before
christmas cummings added
in may all gurkha veterans with minimum four years service won the right to
settle in britain after high profile legal battle led by actress joanna
lumley
the ministry of defence has since set up resettlement office in the nepalese
capital kathmandu to brief applicants about living in britain but cummings
said none of the gurkhas he had so far seen had been to the centre
having not been through any preparation in nepal prior to arrival they re
coming here with no resources to back them up and no means of sustaining
themselves he said
hugh milroy chief executive of veterans aid which deals with homeless former
service personnel had already seen case of gurkha who ended up on the
streets shortly after arriving in britain
we have already had experience of someone arriving at our charity having been
in the country two days and ending up homeless he told bbc television
the defence ministry insisted it was doing great deal to prepare former
gurkhas and their families for life in the uk
more than people had attended the resettlement centre in nepal and
arrangements were in place in britain to help bring the ex soldiers into the
welfare system the ministry said in statement
about gurkhas fought for britain in world war and world war ii and
more than have died in british uniform around now serve in the
british army
