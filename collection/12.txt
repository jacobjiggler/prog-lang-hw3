macedonia imposes tough new smoking ban
skopje jan afp
macedonia began the new year on friday with ban on smoking in bars clubs and
cafes introducing harsh fines for owners of facilities and smokers
under the new regulations smoking is banned in all locations serving food both
indoors and outdoors macedonian health and economy ministers bujar osmani and
fatmir besim said in joint statement
owners of bars and restaurants face fines of between to euros
to dollars for violating the regulations
those caught with cigarettes in areas where smoking is banned will have to pay
between and euros to dollars
an estimated half of the two million population in the former yugoslav republic
is believed to smoke
the tough law was first introduced in december but was soon withdrawn to
allow consumers and business owners time to adjust
smoking is now banned not only indoors but also on balconies or restaurant
terraces
bar and restaurant owners called on state authorities to reconsider some of the
rules fearing the strict law could cost jobs as they expect drop in business
from regular smokers
macedonia has nearly percent unemployment rate
leading egypt clerics back gaza tunnel barrier report
cairo jan afp
council of leading muslim clerics has supported the egyptian government
construction of an underground barrier along the border with gaza to impede
tunnelling by smugglers report said on friday
the islamic research council of al azhar university sunni islam highest seat
of learning said that the tunnels were used to smuggle drugs and threatened
egypt security the al masri al yawm newspaper reported
it is one of egypt legitimate rights to place barrier that prevents the
harm from the tunnels under rafah which are used to smuggle drugs and other
contraband that threaten egypt stability the paper quoted the clerics as
saying
those who oppose building this wall are violating the commands of islamic law
they added after meeting attended by egypt top cleric sheikh mohammed said
tantawi who is government appointee
construction of the underground barrier has drawn angry condemnation from the
hamas rulers of the gaza strip which relies on the tunnels for food and fuel
as well as the weapons and other contraband the barrier is designed to stop
israel has sealed the territory off to all but very limited supplies of basic
goods ever since the islamist group seized control in ousting forces loyal
to western backed palestinian president mahmud abbas
hamdi hassan an islamist member of the egyptian parliament has filed lawsuit
against president hosni mubarak demanding halt to construction of the barrier
the newspaper reported
finland shooting spree prompts new gun debate
helsinki jan afp
finland was in mourning friday after jealous ex lover shot dead his former
girlfriend and four of her work colleagues in the latest armed rampage which has
reignited debate on the country gun controls
ibrahim shkupolli ended his killing spree on thursday by turning his weapon on
himself bringing the overall toll from the tragedy in the normally sleepy
helsinki suburb of espoo to six
as relatives of the victims tried to come to terms with their loss prime
minister matti vanhanen acknowledged it raised new questions about firearms
laws
the incident draws attention to the large amount of handguns in our country
vanhanen said in statement
broad based cooperation within our society is necessary to avoid such tragedies
in the future
finland one of western europe most sparsely populated countries with long
tradition of hunting has one of the largest per capita gun ownerships in the
world
but debate about the level of gun ownership has become hot political topic in
the wake of two shootings at schools in and which left total of
pupils and staff dead as well as the two shooters
new firearms law intended to tighten up licensing requirements is due to be
put before parliament in the spring
investigators said that the gun used by shkupolli was not licenced
the year old was fined by the helsinki district court in for firearm
violation for illegal possession of mm handgun and ammunition
the espoo district court had also fined shkupolli for illegal possession of
calibre handgun and ammunition in
having expressed his condolences to the victims families vanhanen said that
the background of the events will be examined especially the background and
origin of the unlicensed gun
newspapers asked pointed questions about how easily the shooter had been able to
get his hands on weapon even though alarm bells had already been well and
truly sounded
as well as his run ins with the law over illegal firearms he was also the
subject of restraining order issued by court over harassment of his ex
girlfriend
police acknowledge that lessons had to be learned but nevertheless defended
their performance when asked if they could have done more to prevent the
shootings
in retrospect one could have of course assessed the situation in different
ways but according to the knowledge of that moment the police and the justice
system had given him the necessary attention inspector tero haapala told the
private mtv news channel
haapala said that investigators believed that shkupolli actions were prompted
by jealousy
strong line of investigation is the jealousy of the couple in the
relationship which expressed itself so sadly and seriously he said
haapala said that shkupolli appeared to have deliberately sought out his victims
in the mall all of whom worked at the same supermarket where the former
girlfriend worked
the injuries of the victims indicate that the shooter wanted to shoot just
them there were no bullets shot in the direction of bystanders he said in
comments to the online edition of the helsingin sanomat newspaper
witnesses said the shooting sparked panic among the around new year eve
shoppers in the mall in mid morning with many charging headlong for the exit
armed police and medics who rushed to the scene found the bodies of three men
and woman at the prisma supermarket and then later found the ex girlfriend
body at her home
after an extensive search of the mall proved fruitless officers issued
photograph of shkupolli and called on the public to help find him his body was
found several hours later
north korea calls for end to hostile relations with us
seoul jan afp
north korea on friday called for an end to hostile relations with the united
states vowing to work towards nuclear free peninsula seven months after its
last atomic test angered the world community
the call was made in policy setting new year joint editorial of the communist
country state newspapers north korean people must learn and memorize the
editorial which is seen as ideological guidance for the year ahead
the fundamental task for ensuring peace and stability on the korean peninsula
and in the rest of asia is to put an end to the hostile relationship between the
dprk north korea and the usa the editorial said
it is the consistent stand of the dprk to establish lasting peace system on
the korean peninsula and make it nuclear free through dialogue and
negotiations the editorial said according to pyongyang korean central news
agency kcna
north korea left six party nuclear disarmament talks in april last year in
protest at international censure over its launch of long range rocket in may
it staged its second nuclear test since
us envoy stephen bosworth visited the communist nation last month and reached
common understanding on the need to resume the talks which group the two
koreas japan china russia and the united states however no date has been
fixed
in washington state department official said north korea should demonstrate
its good faith by returning to the six party talks
actions speak louder than words the official said speaking on condition of
anonymity good step forward would be to return to six party talks
south korea unification ministry said this year editorial is distinctive in
emphasizing dialogue and negotiations as last year editorial reaffirmed its
commitment to denuclearisation and peace without mentioning dialogue
analysts also said it indicated progress
this means that north korea ordinary people will start being educated about
pyongyang push for an end to enmity with the us professor kim yong hyun of
dongguk univerity told afp
another professor yang moo jin of the university of north korean studies said
the editorial indicates that pyongyang will actively pursue dialogue this year
focusing on the conclusion of peace treaty and nuclear disarmament
the korean peninsula remains technically in state of war because the
conflict between north and south ended with an armistice and not peace treaty
the new year editorial means the north will not call for an end to us
hostility as pre condition for giving up its nuclear weapons but it will push
for both goals an end to hostile relations and denuclearisation at the
same time yang said
the editorial also put great emphasis on what it called bringing about
radical turn in the people standard of living in impoverished north korea
this would be achieved by quicker development of light industry and agriculture
kcna said
