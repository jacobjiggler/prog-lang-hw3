un food agency cuts down somalia operations
nairobi jan afp
attacks by al qaeda linked rebels have led to the suspension of food
distributions in large swathes of somalia leaving one million people outside
the relief net the un food agency said tuesday
rising threats and attacks on humanitarian operations as well as the
imposition of string of unacceptable demands from armed groups have made it
virtually impossible for the world food programme wfp to continue reaching up
to one million people in need in southern somalia it said in statement
somalia has been plagued by almost uninterrupted civil conflict since the
ouster of president mohamed siad barre and is often described as one of the
world worst humanitarian crises
the radical islamist insurgent group shebab whose leader last year proclaimed
allegiance to al qaeda supremo osama bin laden has overrun and looted several
key un compounds in southern somalia in recent weeks
in the areas they control the shebab have also imposed strict conditions on
foreign humanitarian organisations effectively prohibiting their operations
wfp is deeply concerned about rising hunger and suffering among the most
vulnerable due to these unprecedented and inhumane attacks on purely
humanitarian operations the statement said

cia afghan base bomber was triple agent reports
amman jan afp
suicide bomber who killed eight people in an attack on cia base in
afghanistan was triple agent who apparently duped his handlers that boasts he
wanted to die martyr were just cover reports said
the jordanian intelligence services had brought the bomber to eastern
afghanistan with the specific mission of finding al qaeda number two ayman al
zawahiri believing he was their double agent us network nbc news reported late
monday citing western intelligence officials
but instead he blew himself up at forward operating base chapman in khost
province near the pakistani border killing seven cia agents and top jordanian
intelligence officer and wounding six other people
the killings marked the us central intelligence agency worst single loss of
life since the bombing of the us marine barracks in beirut in
there has been no immediate official comment on the reports from the jordanian
authorities
nbc identified the bomber as humam khalil abu mulal al balawi and said that the
slain jordanian intelligence official captain ali bin zeid member of
jordan hashemite royal family was his supposed handler
in mark of bin zeid seniority king abdullah ii queen rania and other
royals were on hand to receive his body when it was flown back to jordan on
saturday following the december bombing
bruce riedel former cia officer and white house adviser told afp that
according to unconfirmed intelligence reports zawahiri himself had ordered
balawi to carry out the attack using the pretext of information about his
whereabouts
the bomber allegedly was sent by ayman zawahiri himself to conduct the attack
and claimed he had information on zawahiri riedel said
nbc reported that the bomber had called his handler to say he needed to meet
with the cia team in khost because he had urgent information about zawahiri
bin zeid family told afp that the intelligence officer had been in afghanistan
for days and had been due to return home on the day he was killed
the jordanian intelligence services reportedly concluded they had turned balawi
when he announced willingness to work for amman and washington while in
custody more than year ago
jihadist websites reported his arrest in december without specifying its
location us monitoring service site intelligence said
balawi had been prolific contributor to jihadist websites over the previous
two years under the online pseudonym abu dujana al khorasani site added
he continued to issue calls for jihad or holy war even after his release from
custody when he was supposed to be working as jordanian agent the monitoring
group added
in september posting on site run by al qaeda in afghanistan he
glorified martyrdom and called on others to follow his example
if muslim dies in the cause of allah he will grant his words glory that
will be permanent marks on the path to guide to jihad with permission from
allah site quoted him as saying
if love of jihad enters man heart it will not leave him even if he wants
to do so
indeed what he sees of luxurious palaces will remind him of positions of the
martyrs in the higher heaven
jordan has been staunch western ally for decades but it has never confirmed
the presence of its troops or intelligence officers in afghanistan as part of
the us led coalition which overthrew the taliban regime in
the authorities in amman have repeatedly expressed commitment to the us war
against terror
us press reports have said that that commitment extended to helping in
interrogations of non jordanian suspects captured by the cia and transferred to
jordan in now infamous rendition flights
the authorities in amman likewise never confirmed any role in the us led
invasion of neighbouring iraq in
the invasion sparked opposition protests and jordanian national abu musab al
zarqawi went on to lead al qaeda in iraq until he was killed in june
us air strike near baquba north of baghdad
jordanian public opinion had already turned against the jihadists after
zarqawi group claimed suicide bombings against luxury hotels in amman
that killed people

german official unemployment at percent in
frankfurt jan afp
german unemployment averaged percent of the workforce last year with
total of million unemployed the federal labour agency said on tuesday
that represented an increase from the level of percent trend that
was also seen month on month in europe biggest economy
in december unemployment rose to percent from percent the previous
month the agency said
the raw number of jobless the headline figure in germany climbed in december
to million it added
after three months of declining unemployment numbers it was only matter of
time before german unemployment would increase again ing senior economist
carsten brzeski said adding that it was probably not the last rise
unemployment should continue to increase until mid and should peak at
around million the economist forecast which he noted would be well below
the peak of million generated by germany last recession in
in addition to short time work scheme that has kept more than million
workers on state subsidised reduced hour payrolls official data shows that
germany benefitted from net increase in new companies last year
the country relatively rigid labour market and the government boost thus
appears to have averted an explosion in unemployment amid the slowdown but
whether such labour market can be growth driver during the recovery is
another story brzeski said

iran repeats offer for gradual nuclear fuel swap
tehran jan afp
iran repeated on tuesday its counter proposal for staged swap of its low
enriched uranium leu for nuclear fuel from abroad for research reactor
leaving details open to discussion
if the other side expresses readiness for the gradual and staged swap we will
discuss the details foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told
reporters
iran has rejected an offer drawn up by the international atomic energy agency
iaea aimed at allaying fears about tehran nuclear drive by shipping most of
its leu stockpile abroad to be further enriched into reactor fuel
instead it has come out with its own proposal of simultaneous and staged swap
of leu for reactor fuel
world powers gave iran until the end of to accept the un brokered deal but
the deadline was ignored prompting talk of fresh sanctions against the islamic
republic
iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki insisted on saturday that tehran in
fact had until the end of january to reach uranium swap deal stressing it
will press on with plans to produce highly enriched nuclear fuel if there is no
agreement
mottaki gave the west one month ultimatum to accept the iranian counter
proposal
mehmanparast stressed that tehran considered three options for its nuclear fuel
supply
either we buy the fuel or cooperate for swap or if they do not prepare grounds
for these we will pursue our own fuel production plan
iran is already under three sets of un security council sanctions over its
defiance and refusal to suspend enrichment which lies at the heart of
international fears about its nuclear programme
the process that makes nuclear fuel can also be used to make the fissile core of
an atomic bomb
the united states israel and other world powers suspect tehran is making
nuclear bomb under the guise of civilian programme an allegation iran
vehemently denies
