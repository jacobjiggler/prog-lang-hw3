football angola look to exploit home advantage
luanda jan afp
angola approach the african cup of nations as one of the lowest ranked
contenders and after failed campaign to qualify for the world cup
yet under skilled new coach manuel jose angola whose fortunes have dipped since
appearing at the world cup are counting on the hosts effect to steer them
to at least the knock out stages
the palancas negras black antelopes will be hoping to emulate egypt or
tunisia winners of africa biennial competition on home soil
the hosts nigeria came second ghana third and significantly
apparent whipping boys mali and burkina faso fourth
as hosts angola were automatically seeded for november draw which pitted them
against malawi back for second appearance years after last competing mali
and algeria
jose team making fifth appearance tuned up for the competition with two
home friendlies in november goalless draw against ghana and draw with
congo
since his arrival jose has concentrated on sorting out what he regarded as
weak spot in angola make up the central defence and adopted or
system in friendlies
he believes he has made progress since his appointment six months ago saying
we have solid and united team which is growing game by game the team has
improved so much since june it completely different team
ghana serbian coach milovan rajevac was impressed and believes angola will
have major say in proceedings
think angola is playing modern and fast football and think they will show
lot in the nations cup he said
at the world cup angola failed to make it to the second round after
loss to former colonial power portugal goalless draw with mexico and
stalemate with iran
at the african cup of nations they were beaten by eventual winners
egypt in the quarter finals after finishing runners up in their first round
group with draws against south africa and tunisia and win over senegal
win lose or draw in january angola are already winners according to fernando
baptista moutinho executive director of angola organisation committee in
huila one of the match venues
regardless of what happens on the pitch angola has already won just by hosting
the tournament he says

intends to sell in more than countries worldwide including europe parts of
asia and north america
karl slym head of gm india said the beat priced at rupees
dollars in its basic form would help increase indian sales by percent this
year to units but he admitted that the competition was getting tough
there is competitive market in india he told reporters there are more and
more players coming in with different capabilities
all new entrants are looking to unseat indo japanese alliance maruti suzuki

selling brand for two decades
this year show is the th but it first caught the world attention in
when indian manufacturer tata motors unveiled its nano the world cheapest car
