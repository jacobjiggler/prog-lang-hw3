football arsenal gunning to underline title credentials
london jan afp
arsene wenger admits arsenal have golden opportunity to underline their
credentials as serious premier league title challengers in wednesday crucial
clash with bolton
just six weeks ago wenger side seemed to have been exposed as title also rans
after chelsea win at the emirates stadium left the gunners points
behind the leaders
but surprising slips from chelsea and manchester united have handed arsenal an
unexpected opportunity to get back in the race which they have seized with an
impressive run of five wins from six matches
now victory over managerless bolton in front of the emirates faithful will
lift the north londoners into second place and within one point of table toppers
chelsea
wenger is convinced his young injury hit squad won be fazed by the prospect
of moving above united and increasing the pressure on chelsea
we know bolton will be big game we will prepare well and be up for it
wenger said the victory at west ham on sunday will help us believe we can do
it again
for arsenal to defy the critics and mount prolonged title challenge would be
significant achievement for wenger who has seen his side decimated by injuries
cesc fabregas robin van persie theo walcott and gael clichy have all missed
large periods of the season and now wenger loses rapidly improving midfielder
alex song for month as the cameroon star flys off to the african nations cup
song sturdy presence in front of arsenal occasionally flaky defence has
played significant role in the gunners resurgence but wenger hopes french
midfielder abou diaby can perform the role just as well
we will miss song because he is an important player wenger said in the
system we play he plays in front of the defence and we will have to find new
balance without him
diaby came off the bench to help arsenal come from behind to beat london rivals
west ham in the fa cup third round on sunday and he is sure to return to the
starting line up against bolton
the year old has more attacking attitude than song but he believes he can
rise to the challenge of filling in for his team mate
will talk about that with the manager and if he wants me to play in that
position am happy to do it we will see what happens diaby said
alex is very important player in our team because he is going we have to
replace him and make sure we do the same job without him
being completely out classed by chelsea could easily have shattered the morale
of more fragile squad but arsenal managed to maintain their equilibrium and
diaby insists they deserve credit for showing strong mentality under heavy
criticism
we have the quality to beat every team and when we lost to chelsea it was very
frustrating but we have won games since then and that is the most important
thing he said
we showed that mentally we are strong because we had big games but we kept
winning
wanderers can move out of the relegation zone with draw on wednesday but the
most important development in the club future will take place in the boardroom
as chairman phil gartside pursues burnley boss owen coyle former bolton
striker to replace gary megson who was sacked following last week draw
with hull
coyle has held talks with bolton and could be installed this week if
compensation of around three million pounds is agreed but caretakers chris
evans and steve wigley will pick the team that takes on arsenal

football beckham and toni eye openers in italy
rome jan afp
high profile new arrivals david beckham and luca toni will be aiming to be in
the thick of the action for ac milan and as roma respectively when the italian
league restarts after the winter break on wednesday
england midfielder beckham is expected to start on the bench and come on at some
point for second placed milan in their home game against genoa after returning
to the club on loan from the los angeles galaxy following successful stint at
the san siro last season
beckham is in italy until the end of the campaign to get the top level football
needed to push for place in fabio capello england world cup squad
since he left last year milan have changed coach and system of play and some
pundits are unsure how he will fit into new boss leonardo formation
there has even been speculation he could be used at full back with massimo oddo
out through injury prospect that does not scare the former manchester united
and real madrid man
the system has changed it will take some time to understand this new system
but not much he told press conference last week
be happy to play in any role even in goal versatile midfielder and
this will help me in any position
the year old will have been boosted by the praise of milan medical staff
for his fitness after concerns that he might still be hampered by the ankle
problem that troubled him in the run up to the galaxy defeat to real salt lake
in november major league soccer cup final
milan who trail inter by eight points with game in hand after their visit to
fiorentina before the break was postponed due to snow face opposition
reinforced by david suazo after genoa signed the honduras forward on loan from
inter
like beckham toni has returned to serie on loan to boost his chances of
reaching the world cup finals after falling out of favour at bayern munich and
being left out of recent italy squads
but unlike the englishman the centre forward is tipped to go straight into the
starting lineup at cagliari for roma who have climbed to fourth since claudio
ranieri replaced luciano spalletti in the dugout after bad start with fellow
world cup winner francesco totti doubt with knee problem
the rome club now want to consolidate this position and qualify for the
champions league after missing out on place in the competition this season
toni is confident he can contribute
haven just come here for the world cup he told reporters at the weekend
ve come here to score goals and give hand to the roma cause
inter visit chievo verona without samuel eto after cameroon irked coach jose
mourinho by refusing to let the striker play the game and join their african

goran pandev looks sets to help cover the absence after media reports that the
macedonia striker had medical with the champions on sunday
free agent pandev liberated himself from his contract with lazio last month
after being frozen out for making transfer request in the summer
if the deal goes through mourinho may be tempted to use him immediately on the
wing as he is short of midfielders because of dejan stankovic and thiago
motta suspensions
juventus boss ciro ferrara could face the sack if his third placed side fall to
