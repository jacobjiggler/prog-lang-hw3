china arrests thousands in internet porn crackdown
beijing jan afp
china arrested more than people in crackdown on internet pornography in
officials said vowing tougher online policing in the new year as key
element of state security
china maintains strict censorship of the internet to curb what the government
deems to be unhealthy content including porn and violence an effort that has
become known as the great firewall of china
authorities in december offered rewards of up to yuan dollars to
internet users who report websites that feature pornography
according to figures published by the ministry of public security late thursday
people were arrested last year under the internet porn crackdown and
illegal porn related sites were shut down
the ministry in statement on its website did not specify if all of those
arrested were later prosecuted
it said it would strengthen punishment for internet operators that violate the
laws and regulations in the coming year and severely punish operations that
have serious problems with harmful information
purifying the internet environment and cracking down on internet crimes is
related to long term state security the ministry said
internet use has expanded at dizzying pace in china which now has the world
largest online population with at least million users
the government is concerned that left unchecked the internet could become
means for ordinary citizens to spread information harmful to society
including ideas that are critical of the communist authorities
china has blocked several social networking sites such as facebook and twitter
citizens can only gain access to such sites by using proxy servers
last year beijing threatened to sanction major websites including search engine
giants google and baidu alleging that pornography and other material that could
corrupt young people was turning up in search results
authorities effectively cut off internet access in the far western xinjiang
region after deadly ethnic unrest erupted there in july
the government says terrorists separatists and religious extremists used the
internet telephones and mobile text messages to spread rumours and hatred as
the violence broke out
earlier this week limited access to state run news websites was restored

judge dismisses charges against blackwater defendants
washington dec afp
in rebuke to government prosecutors federal judge on thursday dismissed
criminal charges against five blackwater security guards accused of fatally
shooting people in baghdad in september
judge ricardo urbina said prosecutors violated the defendants rights by using
incriminating statements they had made under immunity during state department
probe to build their case
the government used the defendants compelled statements to guide its charging
decisions to formulate its theory of the case to develop investigatory leads
and ultimately to obtain the indictment in the case urbina ruled
in short the government had utterly failed to prove that it made no
impermissible use of the defendants statements or that such use was harmless
beyond reasonable doubt
the security guards had been compelled to provide the incriminating evidence
during justice department probe the court said but the us constitution bars
the prosecutors from using statements compelled under threat of job loss in
any subsequent criminal prosecution
the case was among the most sensational that sought to hold blackwater employees
accountable for what was seen as culture of lawlessness and lack of
accountability as it carried out its duties in iraq
the five guards who had been part of convoy of armored vehicles had been
charged with killing unarmed iraqi civilians and wounding others during an
unprovoked attack at busy baghdad traffic circle using gunfire and grenades
the men had faced firearms charges and up to years in jail on each of
manslaughter counts
us prosecutors had alleged that the guards specifically intended to kill or
seriously injure iraqi civilians and according to court documents alleged that
one of the guards told another that he wanted to kill iraqis as payback for
bragging about the number of iraqis he had shot
urbina explained in his opinion that federal prosecutors were offered an
opportunity during three week hearing that began in mid october to prove
that they had not made use of the defendants statements in building their case
and were unable to do so
the explanations offered by the prosecutors and investigators in an attempt to
justify their actions were all too often contradictory unbelievable and
lacking in credibility urbina wrote
he added the court must dismiss the indictments against all of the
defendants
urbina added that in reckless violation of the defendants constitutional
rights investigators prosecutors and government witnesses inappropriately
relied on statements that guards were compelled to make in debriefings by the
state department shortly after the shootings the state department hired the
guards to protect its officials
the five defendants were security guards employed by blackwater worldwide which
since has been renamed xe corporation
attorneys for the guards have said they did not fire their weapons with criminal
intent but thought they were under attack
but critics repeatedly have accused the company of rambo style shoot first
ask questions later approach when carrying out security duties in iraq
state department review panel in concluded that there had been
insufficient us government oversight of private security firms hired in iraq to
protect diplomats and to guard facilities
the panel found that as result there was an undermined confidence in those
contractors both among iraqis and us military commanders
north korea calls for end to hostile relations with us
seoul jan afp
north korea on friday called for an end to hostile relations with the united
states vowing to work towards nuclear free peninsula seven months after its
last atomic test angered the world community
the call was made in policy setting new year joint editorial of the communist
country state newspapers north korean people must learn and memorize the
editorial which is seen as ideological guidance for the year ahead
the fundamental task for ensuring peace and stability on the korean peninsula
and in the rest of asia is to put an end to the hostile relationship between the
dprk north korea and the usa the editorial said
it is the consistent stand of the dprk to establish lasting peace system on
the korean peninsula and make it nuclear free through dialogue and
negotiations the editorial said according to pyongyang korean central news
agency kcna
north korea left six party nuclear disarmament talks in april last year in
protest at international censure over its launch of long range rocket in may
it staged its second nuclear test since
us envoy stephen bosworth visited the communist nation last month and reached
common understanding on the need to resume the talks which group the two
koreas japan china russia and the us however no date has been fixed
in washington state department official said north korea should demonstrate
its good faith by returning to the six party talks
actions speak louder than words the official said speaking on condition of
anonymity good step forward would be to return to six party talks
south korea unification ministry said this year editorial is distinctive in
emphasizing dialogue and negotiations as last year editorial reaffirmed its
commitment to denuclearisation and peace without mentioning dialogue
analysts said the use by the north of the new year day joint editorial was
significant
this means that north korea ordinary people will start being educated about
pyongyang push for an end to enmity with the us professor kim yong hyun of
dongguk univerity told afp
professor yang moo jin of the university of north korean studies also said the
editorial indicates that pyongyang will actively pursue dialogue this year
focusing on the conclusion of peace treaty and nuclear disarmament
the korean peninsula remains technically in state of war because the
conflict between north and south ended with an armistice and not peace treaty
it means the north will not call for an end to us hostility as pre condition
for giving up its nuclear weapons but it will push for both goals an end to
hostile relations and denuclearisation at the same time yang said
the editorial also put great emphasis on what it called bringing about
radical turn in the people standard of living in impoverished north korea
this would be achieved by quicker development of light industry and agriculture
kcna said
our building of the country into an economic giant is aimed to all intents and
purposes at radically improving the people standard of living the editorial
quoted north korea all powerful leader kim jong il as saying
professor kim yong hyun said the north was now whipping up its people to
increase production after the country last month carried out surprise currency
revaluation aimed at reasserting government control of the economy
the editorial warned neighbouring south korea against committing acts that may
aggravate the confrontation and tension and take the road of respecting the
inter korean declarations promoting north south dialogue and improving the
relations between both sides
