football duarte left to concentrate on burkina faso
ouagadougou jan afp
until he was relieved of his club responsibilities in december paulo duarte was
doing hiddink and combining managing burkina faso and le mans
guus hiddink performed both roles with russia and chelsea last season but for le
mans the arrangement proved untenable and duarte became the first coach in the
french first division to be sacked this season
when le mans president henri legarda requested that duarte give up his other job
to help get the french club off the foot of the table the portuguese said
president ve given my word to burkina faso will not be back until the end
of january
legarda said there was no choice but to sack duarte told him respected he
wanted to honour that promise but that need someone to be percent at this
club
legarda added will miss paulo duarte because in spite of the results we ve
had our club was going in the right direction under him
the year old portuguese manager is former midfielder who was hired by
burkina faso in
football togo coach herbert vehud
lome jan afp
frenchman hubert velud will be making his debut at the african nations cup in
angola after he took charge of togo in september
goalkeeper in his playing days vehud got off to winning start when togo
beat gabon in lome in november on the final day of the combined world cup
and nations cup qualifying tournament
he has spent his entire professional career as player with reims he was
nicknamed the cat by supporters of the club in tribute to his agility
he began his coaching career with french third division side clermont foot
auvergne and made history by winning promotion to the second division
he also had spells at creteil and beauvais before he was named togo coach late
last year
fish out of water when did animals move to land
paris jan afp
fossilised footprints found in polish quarry of an enigmatic long extinct
creature have prompted palaeontologists to reopen the file of how life in the
sea moved to the land
key theory in evolutionary biology is that tetrapods four limbed land
loving vertebrates emerged from fishes with pairs of lobed fins
the intermediate stage in the process was fishes called elpistostegids whose
head and body had tetrapod like shape but still retained fins instead of hands
and feet according to this idea
the star of these missing link creatures is tiktaalik large shallow water
fish whose fossilised remains were found in just kilometres
miles short of the north pole unearthed from river sediments on canada
ellesmere island
tiktaalik lived around million years ago although even older
elpistostegids dating back to million years have been found
but trackways found at disused quarry at zachelmie in the holy cross mountains
of southeastern poland have thrown the timeline and the elpistostegids role
into question
in paper released by the british weekly journal nature team led by tetrapod
sleuth per ahlberg of uppsala university sweden report the finding of dozen
distinctive hand and foot prints from creature that lived around
million years ago
that makes them million years older than the earliest tetrapod fossils found
so far and whopping million years earlier than the first known
elpistostegids
the imprints made in what at the time was the mud of shallow marine lagoon
are up to centimetres inches wide which suggest the tetrapod was
around metres feet long
there is no sign of body drag which suggests that the tetrapod must have been
floating on the water while walking on the muddy bottom say the authors
the find is radical for it implies that tetrapods showed up much earlier than
thought
instead of living in river deltas and lakes before sliding on to land they
thrived in shallow seas trampling the mud of balmy coral reef lagoons
just as important the new theory suggests that the once coveted elpistostegids
or at least the ones unearthed so far were just failed branch rather
than part of the stem from which all land vertebrates including us evolved
the prints force radical reassessment of the timing ecology and
environmental setting of the fish tetrapod transition as well as the
completeness of the body fossil record says the study
football humble serb with the winning habit
accra jan afp
ghana coach milovan rajevac may lack the sharp tongue of sir alex ferguson the
charisma of jose mourinho and the sartorial elegance of fabio capello
but with his astute reading of the game his strong work ethic and attention to
detail his supporters will say he can be mentioned in the same breath as this
famous trio after the year old serb ensured ghana became the first african
qualifiers for the world cup in south africa
that was the definitive answer to domestic critics unhappy with his faltering
english and zero africa coaching experience when chosen to succeed claude le roy
in
the biggest claim to fame of the former defender was playing for and coaching
ex european champions red star belgrade
the serb is part of unique ghana serbia double as compatriot ratomir dujkovic
steered the black stars to the world cup
he has won over his critics in style with midfielder stephen appiah saying
milovan has coached consistently over the past decade turning small clubs into
successful ones and knew he would succeed with ghana provided the necessary
support was provided

football ivory coast coach vahid halilhodzic
paris jan afp
vahid halilhodzic became the manager of ivory coast on may replacing
the german uli stielike whose contract was not renewed
halilhodizic was capped times scoring eight goals for the yugoslav national
team he was twice the leading scorer of the french league with fc nantes
after retiring he coached number of teams including lille rennes and paris
saint germain where he was based between and
he was the head coach of trabzonspor in the season and al ittihad of
saudi arabia in
halilhodzic is concerned about player fatigue
imagine someone plays up to three matches in week players are supposed to
rest but in my team many of the players have lot of responsibilities for
their clubs he said
but he added the team is in high spirits and our focus is to win the africa

football chart topper dagano key to burkina cup campaign
ouagadougou jan afp
run your eye through burkina faso squad for the african nations cup and one
name jumps off the page moumouni dagano
any of the managers in angola would love to have the qatar based striker in
their midst after he netted goals to become leading scorer in the qualifying
competition
the al khor attacker eye for goal will be fully required over the next few
weeks with his country facing stiff first round opposition against the likes of
didier drogba and michael essien in group
born on new years day in dagano joined al khor from french side sochaux
with whom he won the french cup scoring goal in the final
he also had spells with guingamp in france belgian clubs genk and germinal
beerchot having started his playing career with burkina faso side etoile
filante
he has caps to his name
football togo star emmanuel adebayor
lome jan afp
manchester city striker emmanule adebayor is togo leading scorer with goals
in appearances he was named the confederation of african football caf
player of the year for after superb season with arsenal
the bean pole striker was top scorer in the african zone of the qualifying
series for the world cup with goals as togo upstaged the likes of mali
to reach their first ever world cup
this tall striker is technically gifted who has in the past four years proved
to be the primary source of inspiration for togo
he has also been known for falling out with the football authorities in togo
over how the team is managed and his row with then coach stephen keshi over
bonuses for qualifying for the last world cup was well reported
football out of this world essien
accra jan afp
workaholic michael essien has star quality running through his veins just ask
former ghana coach claude le roy
michael is not normal player he is from another planet told him there was
no other footballer of his level in the world said the frenchman
the greatest assets of player who arrived at chelsea via french clubs bastia
and lyon are phenomenal fitness and strength that enable him to relentlessly
roam midfield
when he moved from lyon to chelsea for million pounds he became at the time
africa most expensive footballer
his nickname is the bison for his tough style and seemingly limitless energy
he missed much of last season with ligament injury but returned to play
major part in ghana world cup qualification campaign
football ivory coast star didier drogba
abidjan jan afp
chelsea striker didier drogba is expected to carry on his red hot form for his
english club to the elephants of the ivory coast at angola
this season the robust playing drogba has scored goals in english premier
league matches while providing eight assists he will most certainly be sorely
missed by the championship chasing chelsea while he is away in angola
drogba is big forceful striker who has continued to work on his finishing
skills he is complimented by several exciting strikers like aruna dindane and
salomon kalou and gervinho in the elephants attack
the former olympique marseille centre forward will be before the world cup in
south africa but he appears to be getting even more deadly in front of goal
with each passing year
like george weah and emmanuel adebayor have done with liberia and togo
respectively drogba has been the inspiration in chief of star studded ivorian
team the elephants will therefore not only be relying on him for goals but for
leadership as they attempt to add to their only nations cup conquest achieved
eighteen years ago
football tough times beckoning for stallions in angola
ouagadougou jan afp
burkina faso are making their seventh appearance in the african nations cup
their best showing semi final berth in when they hosted the competition
the stallions who have never made it to world cup face tough test in
angola in group alongside african giants ivory coast ghana and togo
ranked th in fifa charts the team boast prolific scorer moumouni dagano
whose goal haul saw him finish the continental qualifying campaign as top
scorer
coached by portugal paulo duarte they will be struggling to make it into the
knockout stages
one player who did not figure in the squad was aristide bance who plays for
german first division side mayence he misses out after an apparent row with
duarte
burkina faso squad includes marseille midfielder charles kabore and bance
bundesliga colleagues sanou wilfried who is based with cologne and hamburg
jonathan pitroipa
pitroipa and bance teamed up to score the goals when burkina faso suffered an
honourable loss to the ivory coast in world cup qualifier last year
football giantkillers togo capable of more upsets in angola
lome jan afp
the hawks of togo have so far failed to get past the group stage of the african
nations cup in six appearances but they could well spring surprise or two as
was the case when they qualified for their first world cup four years ago
this tiny west african country made their nations cup debut in in cameroon
but it was not until years later that they staged return to the competition
in the ivory coast
they went on to feature at the and editions of the
tournament
the hawks are drawn in what is regarded as the group of death along with
fellow west african countries ivory coast ghana and burkina faso
the ivory coast and ghana are tipped to advance from this group but in the
ivorian capital city of abidjan football observers have been cautious about the
chances of togo in this section as past records have shown they could be bogey
team for the elephants
the records show that on all occasions that the elephants have been pitched in
the same first round group at the nations cup the ivory coast have failed to go
beyond the group stages
in hosts ivory coast were drawn in the same group as togo cameroon and
egypt and the team ended the first round in third place in in ghana it
