was the same as the elephants finished in third in group that had hosts ghana
cameroon and togo
and in in mali the hawks were drawn with dr congo ivory coast and
cameroon and the elephants finished at the bottom of the group
will this trend be extended at angola
togo star player emmanuel adebayor issued warning to the other teams in their
group in angola
togo have very young team prepared and determined to prove something at the
nations cup we may not be the top contenders but it will be dangerous to rule
us out football has really changed for the better and there are lot of
surprises nowadays said the manchester city striker
togo reached angola from qualifying group that included cameroon gabon
and morocco after tremendous start beating cameroon in accra ghana the
hawks stuttered losing crucial fixtures but were able to finish on third place
with eight points to win qualification
adebayor provides the goals and inspiration but overall togo do not have the
quality or strength in depth as most of their players do not feature in the top
leagues around the world
moustapha salifou of aston villa could be said to be one handful of togolese
players at big club in europe but even the midfielder nicknamed togolese
zidane has struggled to pin down regular place in martin neil side
infighting in the football federation has recently forced the appointment of
caretaker committee headed by caf vice president seyi memene
the hawks of togo who begin their angola campaign against the black stars
of ghana on january will certainly not be strong contenders for the title
and would have to come up with something really special to come through tough
group all the same expect an upset or two from the hawks inspired by adebayor
football despite injuries ghana due for bold run
accra jan afp
ghana aside from hosts south africa were the first team from africa to qualify
for the world cup and they will be disappointed not to make sizeable imprint
on the african nations cup dress rehearsal
under french coach claude le roy michael essien and the rest of the black stars
made bold show to win the edition on home turf taking third place
with le roy since replaced by serb coach milovan rajevac ghana certainly haven
gone backwards but their world cup credentials will be tested to the full in
group which has them pitted against didier drogba ivory coast togo and
burkina faso
they regularly arrive at the african nations cup branded among the favourites
but it is years since they won the last of their four continental titles
the only occasion since then they have come close to lifting the crown was in
in tripoli when they lost marathon penalty shootout against surprise
packets ivory coast after goalless decider
they make cohesive unit under rajevac but the wily serb has suffered series
of setbacks in the build up to angola with central defenders john pantsil and
john mensah and midfielders stephen appiah and laryea kingston all ruled out
through injury
fulham defender pantsil was hurt in his club premier league defeat against
chelsea last week will be replaced in ghana man squad by getafe derek
boateng
regular captain appiah misses his second successive african nations cup
inter milan midfielder sulley muntari also misses out not because of injury but
ill discipline
that will mean ever more responsibility for essien to shoulder in midfield
ghana who won four consecutive matches to seal their ticket to south africa
tuned up with goalless draw against the hosts in friendly albeit lacking
many of their key players
football ivory coast popular favourites to be african kings again
abidjan jan afp
the ivory coast will again be one of the leading favourites to win the
african nations cup as was the case two years ago in ghana
however for all their high ratings the elephants have only won the nations cup
once in after penalty kick shootout victory over ghana they along with
nigeria are therefore one of the big underachievers at this tournament
the ivorians though have become formidable force in the past four years during
which time they reached the final of the nations cup in egypt and qualified
for their first ever world cup
angola will be their th nations cup appearance
in ghana two years ago didier drogba and company were runaway favourites to win
the tournament only for them to be dumped in the semi finals by rampant
egypt who would go on to win record sixth nations cup title
for angola the elephants topped their qualifying group with an impressive
points from six matches this included wins away at closest rivals burkina faso
and guinea
chelsea striker didier drogba has remained the team star performer finding
the back of the net on regular basis for club and country however this is by
no means one man band as his efforts are fully complimented by the likes of
chelsea teammate salomon kalou yaya toure of barcelona and manchester city
skipper kolo toure
if there is problem area in this team it would be in the goalkeeping
department but even that is proving not to be such drawback as lokeren
goalkeeper boubakar barry has continued to improve
this west african nation though appear not to have the luck of the draw as they
have often been pitched in very difficult groups for major tournaments like the
world cup and nations cup
that is again the case in angola where they have to fight their way out of
section that includes fellow west africans ghana burkina faso and togo
it tough draw can say that the group is the hardest admitted coach
vahid halilhodzic
now if you take it match after match it important in this kind of
competition to start with victory
hope that we start well against burkina faso in the first group game but it
will not be easy in this group
he continued we go to the nations cup with great ambition like cameroon
egypt nigeria and even ghana we cannot hide we have great status that must be
maintained
we must fight to the end we have to put all the chances on our side to surpass
all the obstacles this is not the time to try to avoid this or that team you
must believe in your chances
the elephants have already proved they can be the best in africa and could
be well be another chance for the country golden generation to crown their
undoubted talents with another nations cup trophy
whoever underestimates an attack that put away goals in the world cup nations
cup qualifiers will only have themselves to blame

sydney jan afp
futuristic powerboat sent to harass japanese whalers has been sliced in two
and is sinking after clash in antarctic waters activists said on wednesday
all six crew on the ady gil trimaran which holds the round the world record
were rescued unharmed the sea shepherd animal rights group said in statement
the ady gil is believed to be sinking and chances of salvage are very grim
the group said adding the unprovoked attack was captured on film
the shonan maru no suddenly started up and deliberately rammed the ady gil
ripping eight feet of the bow of the vessel completely off it said
crew on the carbon and kevlar trimaran had hurled stinkbombs in their first
clash with the whalers earlier on wednesday
the japanese whalers have now escalated this conflict very violently said
paul watson captain of the sea shepherd steve irwin ship
if they think that our remaining two ships will retreat from the southern ocean
whale sanctuary in the face of their extremism they will be mistaken
we now have real whale war on our hands now and we have no intention of
retreating
the ady gil wave piercing boat formerly known as earthrace jetted round
the world in just under days last year beating the previous record by two

korea urges korea to return to nuclear talks
seoul jan afp
south korea on wednesday urged north korea to return to nuclear disarmament
talks and called on china to step up efforts to bring pyongyang back to the
table
think the north has now secured all face saving measures it needed to
return to the six party talks foreign minister yu myung hwan told yonhap news
agency
now is the time for the north and china to respond more actively to calls for
resuming the talks he said
north korea abandoned the talks which group the two koreas japan china
russia and the us in protest at international censure over its launch of
long range rocket in may it staged its second nuclear test since
my personal expectation is that north korea will return to the talks at an
early date but am cautious in predicting in more precise terms whether it
will do so in february or in march yu said
yu also said the north was believed to have begun developing second way to
build nuclear weapons by
the north apparently launched its uranium enrichment programme immediately
after the geneva agreement yu said in reference to an accord under which
pyongyang vowed to freeze and dismantle its nuclear programme in return for
energy aid
it must have begun the uranium enrichment programme no later than he
said
us envoy stephen bosworth said in december that north korea agreed during his
visit to pyongyang last month to discuss its uranium enrichment programme
whenever the nuclear disarmament talks restart
