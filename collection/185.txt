of scoring in an run stand with kayes who contributed only
mahmudullah then smashed eight fours in his ball knock late in the innings as
the hosts plundered in the closing overs

spanish prosecutor appeals radio executives jail terms
madrid jan afp
spain public prosecutor office on thursday appealed month jail sentences
handed down last month to two radio station heads for revealing secrets about
the opposition popular party
it requested that the sentences given radio cadena ser director daniel anigo
and its news editor rodolfo irago by madrid provincial court be cut to just
five months but did not ask for the convictions to be overturned
the two were found guilty of naming people alleged to have been improperly
registered as members of the popular party in the madrid area in on the
radio station web site
even if the appeal fails the two will not serve time in prison as under spanish
law anyone receving jail terms of less than two years on first offence is
automatically accorded suspended sentence
cadena ser which is owned by spanish media giant prisa the publishers of left
leaning daily newspaper el pais condemned the sentence calling it clear
attack on freedom of expression and information view shared by spanish and
international media associations
the court argued that the right to information that is protected by the spanish
constitution did not apply to the internet in the same way as it did to
television radio and the written press
the court case was brought against the two radio executives by several of the
people listed on cadena ser web page as having been improperly registered as
popular party members

lankan troops executing prisoners during the final phase of their battle against
tamil tiger rebels last year was authentic un envoy said thursday
the video aired on britain channel last august is authentic philip
halston the un special rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary
executions told reporters here
he said the conclusion was reached by three independent experts and called for
genuine and independent investigation by the sri lankan government
he noted that when the video showing the execution of number of tamil tiger
militants stripped naked bound and blindfolded and shot in the head by semi
automatic weapons was shown the colombo government dismissed it as fake
and propaganda by the separatist liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte
halston said he asked three qualified experts to review the video after four sri
lankan specialists had concluded that it was fake
he added that the result of the analysis of the three experts would seem to
point to the need for the government of sri lanka to undertake the investigation
had initially called for
he said colombo should ask the united nations to set up an independent
commission of inquiry
sri lankan authorities have resisted international calls for war crimes
investigation after the united nations alleged that more than civilians
had been killed during the first four months alone
the tamil rebels were finally vanquished in may after nearly four decades of
ethnic bloodshed that left between and people dead

bratislava jan afp
around honking truckers lining key street snarled up the slovak capital
bratislava on thursday in protest at new toll system which they say is flawed
and expensive police said
traffic in bratislava was frozen from am gmt when the truck drivers
blocked both lanes of key road connecting motorway and the city centre said
police spokesman frantisek peczar
several buses and trolley buses got trapped in the traffic jam the passengers
had to get off and continue by foot added bratislava transport authority
spokesman peter kavecky
the electronic road toll system launched on january has already caused traffic
jams at slovak borders with foreign truckers facing delays for hours as they try
to use the new system
vehicles over tons now have to pay an average euro cents us cents
per kilometre on more than kilometres of slovak motorways and main roads
the system has been launched and is working very well transport minister
lubomir vazny told reporters on thursday
there have been small operational problems therefore won call it
excellent he added
but drivers blocking the bratislava street insisted the system was expensive
sometimes faulty and difficult to understand
the new tolling system is pure chaos trucker pavol timko told afp
either we succeed or quit my job can afford to go on under the new
conditions added jaroslav uhrina driver from central slovakia
under the new system bus and truck drivers had to install special metres in
their cabs attached to gps system to count kilometers on the toll roads
but luboslav kristel bus driver whose company only two vehicles and expects
to pay about euros month in toll said he was never sure when the on
board unit started counting kilometres
many truckers have also noticed that the system starts counting even if they
don use paid road but parallel road that is supposed to be free of
charge he said
on thursday afternoon the street was still half blocked and police were busy
stopping further trucks from driving into the city
we are getting ready for long night said police spokesman peczar
we can stay here until the end of the week we have patience and full tanks

world veterinary agency to probe meat climate link
paris jan afp
the world top authority in farm animal health announced on thursday it would
launch study into the role of meat in climate change
the report carried out by independent experts is expected to be published by
the summer bernard vallat head of the world organisation for animal health
known by its french acronym of oie said in paris
it is the first time in its nearly year history that the nation oie is to
carry out an environmental investigation
the agency swaps information about diseases in farm animals and issues
recommendations in veterinary scares such as avian flu
the probe coincides with mounting interest in the role of meat eating in stoking
climate change
farm animals are significant sources of greenhouse gases either directly
through methane emissions from digestion or indirectly such as clearing forests
for pasture and inputs used in raising cattle
vallat who is the oie director general said there had been very strong
request from member states for the report
the investigation scope will be limited and it will not seek to rival or
replicate the work of the un global warming scientists the inter governmental
panel on climate change ipcc he said
by some estimates there will be percent surge in demand for animal protein
by in order to feed the world burgeoning population and demands from
emerging economies he said
whatever happens we are going to have to produce more animals to feed the
planet he told press conference
celebrity vegans such as paul mccartney are urging consumers to boycott meat as
personal contribution to fighting climate change
kilogram pounds of beef causes more greenhouse gas and other pollution
than driving for three hours while leaving all the lights on back home
according to study led by akifumi ogino of the national institute of
livestock and grassland science in tsukuba japan
zimbabwe halts disputed diamond sale
harare jan afp
zimbabwe on thursday halted the sale of carats of diamonds from field
plagued by rights abuses saying the auction did not have approval from
government or the global diamond trade monitor
the diamonds came from the eastern marange fields where the kimberley process
set up to stop the sale of blood diamonds has documented widespread
rights abuses by zimbabwe military against civilians
after rebuke from kimberley zimbabwe handed control of the fields to two
south african firms who on thursday had begun three day auction of the gems
in harare with percent of the revenue going to the government according to
state media
but secretary for mines thankful musukutwa told news conference that
government had stopped the auction because it had not yet won approval from the
kimberley process kp or national authorities
no export will take place prior to certification by the kp monitor he said
the public and the diamond community in particular is therefore being advised
that there will be no sales or exports of diamonds in marange until all
government regulations and kimberley requirements are observed in their
entirety
augustine rukwaya ceo of mbada diamonds one of the two companies running the
marange fields said no sales were made before the auction was halted
buying diamonds is very complex process he told afp
in november zimbabwe escaped ban on its international diamond sales by the
kimberley process
kimberley investigation earlier had found unacceptable and horrific violence
against civilians by authorities including forced labour torture and beatings
by soldiers against villagers
despite calls for zimbabwe suspension over abuses in marange the global body
gave harare june deadline to make reforms to comply with its regulations
zimbabwe went into partnership with two south african owned firms including
mbada to extract diamonds in october
the following month mines minister obert mpofu said that soldiers and police
had withdrawn from the fields and that zimbabwe had complied with more than
percent of the reforms set by kimberley
first terror probe to shock americans white house
washington jan afp
the white house warned americans to brace for certain shock thursday when it
releases first probe into intelligence failures exposed by the christmas
attack on us airliner carrying people
new details about the thwarted bombing of northwest jet will follow
revelations from yemen that young nigerian man charged with carrying out the
plot met radical muslim cleric washington accuses of instigating terrorism
president barack obama who has complained about disastrous intelligence
screw up will make fresh statement thursday as his administration fights
claims it botched the initial response to the attempted suicide bombing
his national security advisor james jones prepared public opinion for the report
by warning americans would feel certain shock when they read about systemic
failures in intelligence operations designed to keep them safe
obama is legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available
bits of information that were available patterns of behavior that were
available were not acted on jones told usa today
noting the failed bid to destroy the jet and the shooting rampage which killed
people at fort hood texas in november by muslim army psychiatrist jones
said clues about extremist attacks had now been missed twice
that two strikes jones said adding that the president certainly doesn
want that third strike and neither does anybody else
furious obama has ordered swift government reviews into the attack on the
flight from amsterdam to detroit centering on existing terrorist watch lists
and on airline security and screening
he was originally scheduled to speak at about pm gmt but the appearance
was delayed by two hours after it emerged he would hold private oval office
meeting with former president bill clinton
on tuesday obama said the review showed us intelligence agencies missed
series of red flags related to umar farouk abdulmutallab who is accused of
trying to destroy the jet with explosives sewn into his underwear
new details meanwhile began to emerge of the planning of the airliner plot
blamed by the united states on al qaeda in the arabian peninsula in yemen
the arab country deputy prime minister for defense and security affairs
rashad al aleemi said abdulmutallab had met anwar al awlaqi us yemeni cleric
also linked to the fort hood massacre
the united states has accused awlaqi of terrorist links and said that nidal
hasan the accused in the november military base shootings in texas that killed
people had also been in contact with the cleric
aleemi said that abdulmutallab may also have been recruited by al qaeda while at
university in london
when he went to britain it seems that he was recruited by islamist militant
groups aleemi said adding that abdulmutallab arrived in yemen after he had
been recruited by al qaeda
sharpening the us conundrum in widening front on the us anti terror fight
aleemi also warned that american military intervention in yemen could backfire
and strengthen jihadists
nigeria smarting from us criticisms of its aviation security procedures
offered to provide washington investigators images of adbulmutallab going
through security checks at lagos airport on december before flying to
amsterdam
justice minister michael aondoaaka told reporters that the images would prove
that security staff had done their job
we have visual information that shows our security agents did what they
were supposed to do the minister told journalists
nigeria has demanded it be removed from us aviation watchlist of countries
including iran iraq syria and afghanistan introduced after security review
ordered by obama
nigeria is not terrorist country nigeria will not cannot be on the list of
countries of interest because we have track record as peacekeeper added
the minister aondoaaka said
abdulmutallab was indicted on six counts wednesday by us grand jury for
attempted murder and trying to use weapon of mass destruction aboard us
plane and could face life imprisonment
in highly unusual public rebuke of the us spy community on tuesday obama said
errors by intelligence agencies before the attack were not acceptable
in private he was even more vociferous telling spy chiefs in meeting in the
white house situation room this was screw up that could have been
disastrous an official said on condition of anonymity

one of the biggest complaints consumers have had is volume inconsistencies
eggers said
we solved that problem dolby volume gives us the capability to choose our
favorite volume level for all media then set aside the remote and never touch it
again
