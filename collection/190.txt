ferrero hershey mull offer for cadbury report
milan jan afp
italy ferrero is in talks with us giant hershey and the blackstone fund to
develop counter bid for british confectioner cadbury over the next fortnight
sources close to the dossier said thursday
ferrero and hershey are continuing talks but the entire deal is quite
complicated one source told dow jones newswires stressing that the italian
group would not go ahead without the backing of an industrial partner
the sources said ferrero whose brands include nutella and kinder was also
considering tieing up with us investment fund blackstone to counter hostile
takeover bid by us giant kraft foods
kraft won conditional clearance from eu competition regulators on wednesday to
go ahead with the bid even though only percent of cadbury shareholders have
so far accepted the us group off which has been strongly opposed by management
at the british company
the wall street journal reported that cadbury had approached us confectionery
group hershey in search of counter offer
the cadbury board has repeatedly rejected kraft cash and shares offer worth
about billion pounds billion euros billion dollars
ferrero reportedly has more than two billion euros billion dollars in
cash and could bring more than five billion euros to joint operation
kraft is the world second biggest snacks group after nestle which has said it
is not in the running to buy cadbury the world second largest confectionery
company behind mars
tie up between kraft and cadbury would merge leading kraft brands oreo
biscuits and maxwell house coffee with cadbury dairy milk chocolate and
trident chewing gum
ferrero and hershey may announce counter offer by january the sources
said
ferrero spokesman declined comment when contacted by afp
