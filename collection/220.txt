policeman critical after bomb in tense ireland
belfast jan afp
police officer was critically ill in hospital on friday after bomb exploded
under his car in the latest upsurge of violence to hit northern ireland as it
faces looming political crisis
peter robinson first minister in the british province power sharing
government condemned the cowardly evil act and vowed northern ireland would
not return to its troubled past
the attack on the policeman came as robinson the leader of the protestant pro
london democratic unionists dup faced calls to consider his position over
alleged financial dealings linked to his wife affair with teenager
the police officer catholic named as paedar heffron was driving to work in
randalstown northwest of belfast on friday morning when an explosion went off
under his seat the attack has been blamed on dissident republicans
year old police officer is critically ill in hospital as result of what
we believe was cowardly terrorist attack on not only that officer but on the
community he served said detective chief superintendent derek williamson
the explosion happened short distance from the british army massereene
barracks where two soldiers were shot dead on march last year the first such
killings in more than decade
it was the latest in string of attempted car bombings since then further
emphasising the threat posed by dissident groups to the fragile peace in the
province
this is terrifying just hope we are not slipping back into the dark old
days everybody thought this was all behind us said heffron cousin martin
totten after the attack
robinson deputy martin mcguinness of the catholic republican sinn fein party
said his thoughts were with the policeman family adding these actions serve
no purpose and will not further any cause
after receiving emergency treatment locally he was transferred to hospital in
belfast with an escort of up to dozen police cars
irish prime minister brian cowen condemned the blast as an act of senseless
violence by tiny minority who will not succeed in deflecting us from the
path of peace on this island
the attack came two days after northern ireland largest loyalist paramilitary
group the ulster defence association uda became the last pro london group to
disarm since the good friday peace accords
but tensions are running high amid deadlock between the dup and sinn fein over
the transfer of police powers from london to belfast the final part of the
devolution process
the storm embroiling robinson only added to the sense of crisis
northern ireland top politician and his wife iris revealed this week she had
had an affair she stepped down as lawmaker last month because of severe
depression that last year caused her to attempt suicide
but the story escalated after bbc programme reported that iris had
secured pounds dollars euros from wealthy developers for
her then year old lover so that he could open cafe
she faces charges she failed to declare her financial interest since she sat on
the council which approved the business project
robinson said friday he had known nothing of her activities but ordered an
official inquiry into his conduct and admitted he would have to consider his
position if he was found guilty of wrongdoing
have consistently indicated that have done nothing wrong that acted
properly he said
he added if there is breach will have to clearly and publicly indicate
that is so and that clearly will mean there are consequences that have to
consider in regard to my position

bitter florida cold drives up orange juice prices
new york jan afp
the bitter cold weather battering florida has sent orange juice prices soaring
on financial markets where traders fear plunge in production that already
appears weak this year
the sunshine state at the southeastern tip of the united states known for its
production of oranges grapefruit and other citrus fruit is facing an even more
brutal blast of freezing air this weekend weather forecasters said
temperatures have dropped below freezing several times this week an unusual
cold snap in florida that has raised fears for the crop that generates more than
nine billion dollars year
the impact is calibrated in new york where frozen concentrated orange juice is
traded like oil and other commodities the benchmark futures contract for
delivery in march climbed friday above dollars pound the highest level
since january
that was percent gain from the price at the end of last week on the
intercontinentalexchange and percent jump from october
rich feltes an mf global analyst said about percent of the state crops
have been exposed to freezing temperatures
the freeze has caught many watchers by surprise he said because forecasters
had predicted warmer than normal january in north america
that killing frost and think that the concern is that there could be
another cold wave coming he added it will take some time to asses the extent
of the losses
florida department of agriculture spokeswoman liz compton said no major damage
had been done so far
the temperatures have gotten low but in most areas it has not stayed below
degrees fahrenheit minus two celsius for more than four hours when damage
begins she said
our greatest concern is the cold front forecast to come in this weekend that
could change things
weather forecasting firm accuweather predicted new colder wave of freezing
temperatures over the weekend
to limit crop damage local authorities have lifted road transport restrictions
to allow producers to speed up the ongoing harvest
concerns have mounted since citrus producers already have had difficult year
especially due to particularly dry conditions
in december even before the surprise deep freeze the us department of
agriculture forecast florida would produce some million tonnes of oranges in
the season decline of percent from year ago
the state produces three quarters of us oranges

highest level ahead of abdulmutallab first appearance since he was tackled by
passengers and escorted from the plane
metal barricades blocked off the street along the austere building where news
crews and small group of demonstrators stood shivering in the slush as
bitter wind tossed light dusting of snow down from blue skies
inside two bomb sniffing golden retrievers and their handlers cautiously combed
every corner of the depression era courthouse leaving nothing to chance
armed federal marshals and local police patrolled the halls and the streets
abdulmutallab hobbled into the courtroom in leg irons white shirt and beige
trousers his arms swinging at his side
he fidgeted in his chair and whispered to his lawyers while waiting for the
judge to arrive then clutched his left hip as he walked up to the dock to answer
brief series of questions from judge bernard friedman
he spoke quietly as he spelled his name for the record and said yes did and
yes do when friedman asked him if he had received the indictment and
understood the six charges which include the attempted murder of people on
board the plane and trying to use weapon of mass destruction
when asked if he had taken any medication in the past hours abdulmutallab
who had been badly burned and briefly hospitalized after the explosives caught
fire said hours yes painkillers
then his court appointed lawyer miriam siefer stepped up to the microphone
at this time our client would like to enter plea of not guilty she told the
judge
with respect to bond we have with our client consent consented to
detention
after few more questions from the judge abdulmutallab was escorted from the
room which had no view of the circus outside
woman wearing black and white head scarf who had sat in the front row to
observe the proceedings was surrounded by crush of cameras as she left the
courthouse and walked through the slush covered street to parking garage
rumors flew as to who the woman might be some speculated that she was
passenger on flight others thought she was family member
man who said he represented the nigerian embassy but would not give his name
told reporters that abdulmutallab family had not attended the hearing

duel against swiss defender alinghi

prefer if the rd america cup which is scheduled to held in valencia from
february over three legs were expanded to seven leg event

mind january off the coast of valencia
the boats that both teams have built are like nothing you ve ever seen before
and over the coming days and weeks as we get into our final training sessions
you ll be able to appreciate them for what they are two of the most
technologically advanced and fastest boats ever built said spithill
the mediterranean port of valencia was blanketed by snow on friday as
uncertainty continued over whether the event can take place there as scheduled
next month
oracle last month launched legal challenge that charged alinghi boat fails
to meet the competition nationality rules
the two sides are to meet in singapore on tuesday to discuss the issue along
with the head of the international jury australia david tillett and
representative of the international sailing federation
both syndicates have indicated they are ready to delay the start by several days
and to make it best of seven event

is forced to modify its boat to meet the nationality rules

by the local authorities in valencia

participating vessels must be constructed in the country where the sailing club
which they represent is located

court since alinghi won the last edition of the world most prestigious
yachting event in valencia in
the new york supreme court ruled in april that the cup should be settled by
one on one multihull duel between the two sides next february instead of the
traditional fully fledged regatta with several teams
it also ruled last month that the event must be held in valencia rejecting an
appeal by alinghi which favoured ras al khaimah
