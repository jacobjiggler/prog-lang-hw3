football barca drop first home points in opener
madrid jan afp
barcelona dropped their first home points of the season on saturday after
disappointing home draw with villarreal as the spanish league season resumed
after its winter break
pedro put barca ahead after just seven minutes but david fuster equalised five
minutes after the break to prevent barca from making it perfect eight wins at
camp nou and real madrid three points behind in second can move level on
points with victory at osasuna on sunday
barcelona won all six trophies they entered in and presented their
silverware to the camp nou fans in pre match ceremony the barca players were
also given guard of honour by villarreal players before kick off
barca rested lionel messi while andres iniesta started on the bench as he came
back from injury but the celebrations continued as pedro netted the opening
goal
thierry henry hammered spectacular volley against the crossbar and the ball
fell to pedro who controlled brilliantly on his chest and drilled home
in pedro became the only player in history to score in six different club
competitions in single season and got his off to great start
villarreal refused to be rattled by the early goal and in the th minute came
within inches of equalising with cani cross finding the onrushing fuster who
was unlucky as his downward header looped over the bar
close to the interval alves whipped in another brilliant cross but the lively
henry could not head in as diego lopez did enough to put him off
minutes into the second half barca midfielder sergi busquets lost the ball and
fuster fired wide it was good chance but barca did not heed the warning and
minute later villarreal equalised
cani floated in th minute cross and fuster produced controlled finish at
the back post to stun the hosts
substitute iniesta and zlatan ibrahimovic had chances for barca while giuseppe
rossi had shot cleared off the line by carles puyol two minutes from time
earlier serbian substitute nikola zigic scored stoppage time winner as
valencia defeated espanyol on saturday to move into third spot
the giant zigic came off the bench on minutes and proved the match winner
heading in great cross from joaquin in the second minute of injury time to go
third two points above sevilla
valencia were without david silva and pablo hernandez due to injury so the
attacking onus fell on spanish international david villa
villa the league top scorer with goals had personal duel with espanyol
goalkeeper carlos kameni who twice denied him in the second half
the cameroon goalkeeper thwarted villa in the nd minute with his shot lacking
sufficient power and was on hand again three minutes later to foil villa
espanyol had not won away in the league since mid september and it showed as
they clung on although luis garcia had chance to put his side ahead in the
final quarter of an hour
when villa finally beat kameni he was denied by the post with his header hitting
the woodwork on minutes as valencia frustrations continued
it looked like valencia would drop more valuable points at home something that
has been their problem so far but zigic sealed late win and tore off his
shirt to celebrate

iran standing in its own way on nuclear deal us
washington jan afp
the white house saturday said iran was standing in its own way by imposing an
ultimatum on world powers to accept its version of deal to defuse the building
nuclear showdown
national security council spokesman mike hammer shrugged off iran demand
saying that an existing international atomic energy agency iaea proposal
already offered to tehran was sufficient
the iaea has balanced proposal on the table that would fulfill iran own
request for fuel and has the backing of the international community hammer
said
if getting access to fuel is iran objective then there is absolutely no
reason why the existing proposal which iran accepted in principle at geneva is
insufficient the iranian government is standing in its own way
the un nuclear watchdog had proposed iran ship most of its low enriched uranium
to russia and france for processing into fuel for research reactor
tehran rejected december deadline to accept this risking new un sanctions
but it said on tuesday it was ready to swap its low enriched uranium for nuclear
fuel abroad while insisting the exchange happen in stages
