at the end of the day he said
the year old montgomerie and partner pablo martin of spain made brilliant
start by winning the first two holes but world number ishikawa and countryman
koumei oda reeled off four birdies in eight holes to take control
back to back birdies at the island green eighth and the ninth where ishikawa
chipped in from yards were key to the victory at amata spring country club
the japanese duo wrapped up the contest and with an unlikely halve at the
th where ishikawa lost ball in the bushes
was not looking to chip it in at the ninth but it turned out to be very good
for the team especially after the birdie at the eighth said ishikawa who
became the youngest winner of the japan tour moneylist after four wins last
season
thai duo thongchai jaidee and prayad marksaeng who had per cent record
last year grabbed the second point for asia with scrappy and victory over
world number seven henrik stenson and england simon dyson
the local heroes managed just three birdies but were never behind as swedish big
gun stenson and dyson carded six bogeys against solitary birdie in ragged
round
the swedish duo of robert karlsson and alexander noren gave europe much needed
point with thumping and victory over liang wen chong of china and korea
charlie wi
the danish swedish combination of kjeldsen and hanson clawed back from two holes
down with five to play for fighting halve with singh and bhullar
they came close to win with former asian number one singh holing tricky putt
on the last for the half point

egypt bans british mp galloway from entering country
cairo jan afp
egypt told british mp george galloway he was persona non grata on friday after
activists who joined him to send an aid convoy to gaza clashed with police
but officials denied that they had deported the left winger
foreign ministry official told galloway he was no longer welcome before he
left cairo airport for london an afp reporter at the airport said
the foreign ministry later issued statement saying galloway would not be
allowed to return to egypt
the decision came two days after activists with the viva palestina convoy
clashed with police in the port town of el arish kilometres miles from
the gaza border
they had been protesting an egyptian decision to send some of the convoy
trucks to gaza through israel
egypt allowed most of the convoy and galloway to enter gaza after the clashes
spokeswoman with the viva palestina convoy said galloway had returned to egypt
earlier on friday after hearing reports that seven members of the convoy had
been arrested
seven protesters were arrested during tuesday clashes but police swapped them
for four policemen held by the activists prosecutor in el arish later issued
warrants for the arrest of the seven
viva palestina said galloway and companion were forced into van on the
egyptian side of the rafah border crossing and taken to cairo airport
galloway was officially deported from cairo today friday when egyptian
plain clothes police officers bundled him onto london plane the statement
said
security official said six police cars had waited for galloway at the border
crossing and escorted him to cairo security and airport officials denied he was
deported saying he left willingly
although it was not the first convoy led by galloway to deliver aid to gaza the
arrival of the convoy early this year came amid bitter dispute between egypt
and the organisers
the convoy was held up for days in the jordanian port town of aqaba after egypt
refused it entry through the southern sinai
the convoy was forced to travel to the syrian port of latakia and take ferry
to el arish on egypt mediterranean coast
egypt accused galloway who had once called for the overthrow of egyptian
president hosni mubarak in london rally of trying to embarrass the country
which has refused to permanently open its rafah border crossing with gaza
israel has closed its border with gaza to all but limited supplies since the
islamist hamas movement seized control of the territory in
last march canada refused galloway entry saying that he supported hamas which
it blacklists as terrorist group like the european union and the united
states
