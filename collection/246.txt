moody upgrades turkish govt rating
ankara jan afp
ratings agency moody upgraded the turkish government debt rating on friday
to ba from ba and changed the outlook to stable from positive citing
stronger financial shock absorption capacity
although turkish growth has contracted very sharply the resilience of the
public finances relative to past such crises has been notable moody analyst
sarah carlson said in statement received here
the ability of the government and the country more generally to regroup when
faced with very significant economic and financial challenge indicates that
turkey has reached higher level of resiliency which is what our ratings
ultimately reflect she said
the turkish economy fell into recession in the first quarter of it
contracted by percent in the first nine months of the year
market watchers expect fourth quarter figures to confirm return to growth but
warn that major risks remain pointing at gaping budget deficit and threat
of populist spending ahead of general elections in
last week the government announced series of tax increases striving to
narrow the budget deficit which was six fold the original target last year
the budget envisages percent increase in tax revenues and deficit
of billion lira billion dollars billion euros
also thursday turkey statistics institute announced that industrial output
declined by percent in november on month basis defying market
expectations of an increase of about two percent
but taking into account adjustments for seasonal and calendar effects the
figure did not depict negative outlook yet it was in line with our slow
recovery scenario fortis bank said in reaserch note

the incident happened short distance from the british army massereene
barracks where two soldiers were shot dead on march last year the first such
killings in more than decade that triggered fears of an upsurge in
paramilitary violence
it is the latest in string of attempted car bombings since then further
underscoring the threat posed by dissident groups to northern ireland fragile
peace
political tensions are high in northern ireland with the first minister peter
robinson vowing to carry on despite making an emotionally charged admission this
week that his wife had an affair with teenager and tried to commit suicide
while suffering from depression
furthermore the main protestant and catholic parties who share power in the
province devolved assembly are at loggerheads over when policing and justice
responsibility should be transferred from london
northern ireland has been largely peaceful since the good friday agreement

cabin crew association said the listing could be blessing in disguise
we could go through temporary but painful racial profiling embarrassing pat
downs and travelling discomfort due to long queues and flight delays

reassure the international community of our readiness to battle terrorism
