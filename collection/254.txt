football picasso gives carthage eagles lift
luanda jan afp
the rise of oussama picasso darragi from club reject to tunisia playmaker owes
much to the sharp eye of former national team goalkeeper chokri al ouaer
he and fellow official of tunis club giants esperance spotted darragi and were
astonished he was not considered good enough even for the blood and gold
reserve team
the duo issued an ultimatum to brazilian head coach carlos cabral include
oussama in the first team squad or face the axe he refused and was fired soon
after
even then national coach humberto coelho was not sold on the midfielder as the
final round of world cup african nations cup qualifiers began last march
starting on the bench for the first two outings darragi finally won place in
the starting line up and his late equaliser against nigeria in abuja set up the
north africans to reach fourth consecutive world cup
alas the chance was scorned after final round loss to mozambique and instead
of gracing south africa with his skills darragi must use angola to inform the
international football community of his rising potential
football rattled tunisia seek nations cup remedy
luanda jan afp
tunisia enter the african nations cup in angola nursing massive hangover
after seeing ticket to the world cup snatched from their grasp late last year
the carthage eagles led nigeria for five qualifying rounds only to lose in
mozambique and be overtaken by super eagles team that grabbed late nairobi
triumph over kenya
pictures of weeping footballers dominated the tunisian media as the country
struggled to accept it would not be making fourth consecutive appearance at
the greatest football show of them all
amid national outcry it was inevitable that heads would roll and experienced
portuguese coach humberto coelho was among the first to be informed his services
were no longer required
the public wanted local faouzi benzarti who guided tunis giants esperance and
the football federation agreed by granting him temporary contract until the
end of the african championship as the eagles chase second title
tunisia hosted and won the nations cup pipping morocco in the first all
north africa decider and germany based defender karim hagui will be the lone
survivor from that squad in angola
quarter finals exits followed in the next two tournaments with penalty shoot
out defeat by nigeria in preceding an extra time loss to cameroon in
thriller two years later
these were good tunisian teams who should have gone further and many blamed the
ultra cautious tactics of frenchman roger lemerre the only coach to win euro
and nations cup titles
coelho also stands accused of lacking adventure particularly in maputo when
win would have taken tunisia to south africa and there is confidence among
supporters that benzarti will not fall into the same trap
drawn with cameroon gabon and zambia in benguela based group benzarti knows
his team face struggle just to make the last eight of the african football
showpiece
and if the carthage eagles live up to media predictions and qualify with four
time champions cameroon title holders egypt or nigeria are likely quarter
finals opponents
anything less than last eight place would be another major blow for tunisians
while the semi finals appear the realistic limit for team full of promise but
short of experienced african campaigners
football midfield magician giresse waves wand over panthers
luanda jan afp
alain giresse formed part of four man france midfield that mesmerised the
world in the and helped his country to glorious feats
hosts france were crowned european champions and reached the world cup
semi finals either side of that achievement with giresse michel plantini jean
tigana and luis fernandez in the vanguard
giresse turned to coaching when he hung up his boots and after working in his
homeland and georgia moved to central africa three years ago as coach of
continental lightweights gabon
progress has been steady rather than spectacular and he quit after
african nations championship qualifying loss at home against cameroon only to be
persuaded to carry on by government minister
cameroon also spoilt gabonese dreams of reaching the world cup for the first
time by beating at home and away inside four days last september but returning
to the nations cup after year absence is an acceptable consolation prize
the team has progressed because my players have an incredible desire to
succeed there is still work to be done though like knowing how to use our
strengths and how to handle difficult moments said giresse
football european giants target gabon defender ecuele
luanda jan afp
gabon rearguard stalwart bruno ecuele does not feature in list of great
african defenders ahead of the nations cup in angola
however that could be about to change with worldwide television coverage of the
three week tournament offering the rising star from french second division
outfit angers chance to make his mark
liverpool and inter milan have been linked with the year old native of
gabonese capital libreville and there have also been reports suggesting interest
from werder bremen and spartak moscow
inter coach jose mourinho took ecuele seriously enough last year to watch him in
person twice and the attention inspired ecuele who combined his defensive
duties in the qualifiers with couple of goals
flattered to be linked with two great european clubs like liverpool and
inter they have managers who are football legends so let me dream of working
with one of them he said
but bruno ducked when asked whether he would prefer to run out at anfield or the
san siro who am to choose need to work hard and the future will decide
football le guen unites indomitable lions
luanda jan afp
hard to please african football superstar samuel eto conducts cameroonian
choir singing the praises of france born national coach paul le guen
he united us at most difficult time when we had to win games he is great
coach and great psychologist with modern football ideas the players want him
to stay for the african nations cup and world cup said eto
the wish of the inter milan striker and his indomitable lions team mates was
granted with le guen carrying on to try and satisfy mandate of winning the
nations cup and reaching the world cup quarter finals
series of bold moves by le guen transformed the indomitable lions from side
in danger of missing the nations cup for the first time since into one of
the title favourites
eto replaced long serving defender rigobert song as captain and several
players dumped by hyper cautious german coach otto pfister like striker achille
webo were recalled
le guen who steered lyon to three consecutive french ligue titles also left
his mark off the field demanding first class airline seats and hotels while
boosting medical staff and training facilities

football french coach turns cameroon into potential champions
luanda jan afp
french coach paul le guen looms large over cameroon team capable of winning
fifth african nations cup title in angola this month
the indomitable lions are in lubango based group with gabon tunisia and
zambia and the widespread media verdict is that the and
winners will top the table with scramble for the runners up slot
assuming they reach the quarter finals cameroon would most likely face title
holders and six time champions egypt or nigeria with the former the preferred
opponent given the desire for revenge
cameroon suffered two losses to egypt at the nations cup in ghana in
an opening round group match and in the final with mistake by veteran
defender rigobert song leading to the mohamed aboutraika winner
by the middle of last year the lions had descended from nations cup silver
medalists to team in danger of not even making it to the first tournament
staged by portuguese speaking country
veteran german coach otto pfister quit after his assistant was fired and former
national goalkeeper thomas black spider nkono watched horrified as struggling
morocco forced goalless draw in yaounde
enter le guen stern do it my way fortysomething with proud pedigree topped
by three consecutive french ligue titles with lyon on short term contract
and his impact was immediate
seemingly ageless central defender rigobert song was the major casualty losing
his place in the starting line up and the captaincy to inter milan striker
samuel eto
song eventually fought his way back into an injury hit defence while eto led
cameroon to victories over gabon twice togo and morocco that ensured
qualification for angola and the world cup in south africa
spain based striker achille webo was recalled in another significant change and
now cameroon are being mentioned alongside ivory coast ghana nigeria and egypt
as potential winners of the january luanda final
down the years cameroon have always had strong core and it remains today with
goalkeeper idriss kameni song midfielder jean makoun and three time african
footballer of the year eto
add strong supporting cast plus the touchline insight of le guen and the wish
of the cameroon sports minister for yaounde victory parade early next month
may well come true
football eto has new nations cup goal
luanda jan afp
cameroon superstar samuel eto hopes to break the individual scoring record of
nine goals at an african nations cup when angola stages the tournament this
month
mulamba ndaye from zaire now democratic republic of congo set the mark at the
finals and egyptian hossam hassan and south african benni mccarthy came
closest to matching him with seven each years ago
my first objective is to score the highest number of goals at single nations
cup tournament eto told reporters in kenya where his team is preparing for
the african football showcase
eto who joined inter milan last year from barcelona in high profile move
has been leading scorer in the previous two editions of the biennial nations cup
with five goals each time
his appetite for hitting the net showed no signs of diminishing in the
qualifiers for angola with nine goals the second highest haul behind less known
moumouni dagano of burkina faso
apart from being the main source of goals eto has proved an inspirational
captain since replacing long serving rigobert song last year when french coach
paul le guen took charge

vietnam police block access after church unrest
my duc vietnam jan afp
vietnamese police on friday blocked afp journalists from an area where
according to priest several catholics were wounded when police used tear gas
in dispute over crucifix
this is special order plainclothes immigration policeman said when afp
reporters tried to enter one road leading to dong chiem parish about
kilometres miles from central hanoi in my duc district
at the only other access road several policemen also refused to let the
reporters pass
one immigration officer said there was land dispute and people were not
allowed to enter for their own protection
the immigration police specialise in dealing with foreigners except for an afp
reporter no other foreigners were visible in the farming area where buffalo
worked the fields
unrest broke out before dawn on wednesday when parishioners tried to stop
large group of police and troops sent to dismantle the crucifix on top of
mountain said nguyen van huu the parish priest
he said parishioners told him the police used electric prods tear gas and
stones against the crowd two of whom were seriously injured and taken to hanoi
for treatment
four or five other parishioners were hurt said the priest who was not present
at the time of the incident troops succeeded in dismantling the cross he
added
as described by the priest the clash was one of the most serious recent
incidents in long running series of church state land disputes
the people have not fully recovered yet he said by telephone on friday
police have refused to comment and no one answered the phone friday at the
local government office the people committee
huu said local authorities argued that the cross which replaced wooden
crucifix destroyed many years ago during wartime was built without permission
last year on state managed land
in fact we have used this land for more than years he said
whether they will try to put up another cross is unclear the priest added
now we have to stabilise the situation and whether we will rebuild the cross or
not we have to consider he said adding that the law does not forbid them
from doing so
officials began seizing church property along with many other buildings and
farms more than years ago when communists took power in what was then north
vietnam
in december catholics began series of demonstrations over seized land
that sometimes involved hundreds of protesters
vietnam has southeast asia second largest catholic community after the
philippines with at least six million followers
the government says it respects freedom of religion
malaysian churches attacked ahead of muslim protests
kuala lumpur jan afp
three malaysian churches have been targeted with firebombs leaving one badly
damaged in an escalating dispute over the use of the word allah by non
muslims
as muslim groups prepared to hold nationwide protests friday police stepped up
security around churches after one in suburban kuala lumpur was set ablaze in
midnight attack that gutted its ground floor
molotov cocktails were thrown into the compounds of two other churches but did
not cause serious damage
home minister hishammuddin hussein appealed for calm amid the conflict over the
use of allah as translation for god by christians and moved to assure
minorities in malay dominated malaysia that they are safe
take the events that happened last night very seriously he told press
conference we want to assure the public that this was not coordinated and
well planned action
let hope for the best in few hours time he said of the protests planned
for after friday prayers centred on the national mosque in the capital
police chief musa hassan said officers had been deployed to protect churches
around the country and to monitor protests at mosques following the attacks and
phone threats against churches
amid conflicting statements from the government and police over whether the
protests would be allowed to go ahead musa said police would not enter mosque
compounds but would advise crowds to disperse
if you try taking any action that will affect security then we the police will
take action he said
pribumi perkasa one of the groups organising the demonstrations condemned the
fire bombings but warned that muslim malays who dominate the population were
deeply concerned
we will continue to voice our feelings in protests today because you cannot
stop the outflow of feelings on this issue the group president ibrahim ali
told afp
think it may have been because of restricting muslims from voicing their
anger and fears that the church attacks took place you must understand that if
muslims are unhappy sure there will be no peace in this country
the high court last week ruled in favour of the catholic herald newspaper
which has used allah as translation for god in its malay language section
the government has said the word should be used only by muslims
the ruling was suspended on wednesday pending an appeal after the government
argued the decision could cause racial conflict in malaysia which is home to
large ethnic chinese and indian minorities
the ground floor of the three storey metro tabernacle church part of the
assemblies of god movement was destroyed in the fire bombing
witnesses saw four people smash the glass and throw incendiaries into the
church building they came on two motorcycles church leader peter yeow told
afp warning other churches to double their guard against any attacks
several hours later the catholic church of the assumption in kuala lumpur
southwest was targeted parish priest philip muthu said
was awoken by men riding on motorcycles who threw kerosene bomb into the
church compound he told afp adding that the fire damaged part of the grounds
molotov cocktail was also thrown into the front porch of the nearby protestant
life chapel church
the bomb damaged the wall and plants in the area but thankfully no one was
injured said church elder wong sai wong
religion and language are sensitive issues in multiracial malaysia which
experienced deadly race riots in
the row over the use of allah is among string of religious disputes that
have erupted in recent years straining relations between malays and minority
ethnic chinese and indians who fear the country is being islamised
more than half of malaysia catholics are from indigenous groups most of whom
live in the borneo island states and who mainly speak malay
