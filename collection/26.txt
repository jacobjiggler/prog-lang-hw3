britain vows action with us on yemen somali extremism
london jan afp
britain and the us will step up action to fight extremism in yemen and somalia
downing street said sunday amid investigations into an alleged al qaeda plot to
bomb us airliner
british prime minister gordon brown and us president barack obama who accused
al qaeda over the plot for the first time saturday also wanted to see bigger
peacekeeping force in somalia to tackle violent radicalism in the region
officials said
downing street and the white house have agreed to intensify joint us uk work to
tackle the emerging terrorist threat from both yemen and somalia in the wake of
the failed detroit terror plot statement said
amongst the initiatives the pm has agreed with president obama is us uk funding
for special counter terrorism police unit in yemen
it added in somalia the pm and president believe that larger peacekeeping
force is required and will support this at the un security council
the announcement came two days after britain called london meeting of world
powers on fighting extremism in yemen where nigerian in custody in the us
over the foiled december plot is thought to have been trained and equipped by
al qaeda
al qaeda inspired shebab insurgents in somalia control large swathes of south
and central parts of the country and have wrested control of much of the capital
mogadishu attacking government and african union peacekeepers
the us said last week that it was sharply increasing its military and economic
aid to yemen
brown and obama have discussed what to do about the situation in series of
phone calls since the alleged plot was uncovered and believe more support for
yemen coastguard is also needed the statement added
brown will also ask that the situation be discussed by the european union and
push for tougher action on yemen from the financial action task force an
international body tackling money laundering and funding for violent extremist
groups
he is also to hold meeting of special committee featuring leading members of
his cabinet to discuss britain response to the alleged plot
on friday the british premier called london meeting of international powers
on yemen on january and announced review of airline security here which
could see the use of full body scanners in british airports
he added that the detroit incident which nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab is
accused of carrying out showed terrorism remains very real global threat as
the world enters new decade eight years after the september attacks
on the us
enemies of democracy and freedom now trying to mastermind death and
destruction from yemen as well as other better known homes of international
terror such as pakistan and afghanistan are concealing explosives in ways
which are more difficult to detect he wrote in an article on the downing
street website
al qaeda and their associates continue in their ambition to indoctrinate
thousands of young people around the world with deadly desire to kill and
maim
our response in security intelligence policing and military action is not
just an act of choice but an act of necessity

state officials said another landslide in the nearby city of angra dos reis
south of rio left at least people dead part of series of mudslides brought
on by incessant rains that have killed at least people across the state of
rio de janeiro since wednesday and left dozens missing
authorities said the hotel sankay was full to capacity with about guests
including children ringing in the new year at the idyllic seaside getaway on
bananal beach
the complex is nestled at the bottom of jungle covered hillside which gave way
before dawn friday on new year day transforming the tourist paradise into an
unimaginable hell
it was deafening noise ve never heard anything like it loud thunder
that wouldn stop felipe gomes martins hotel neighbor told brazil news
website
there was lot of earth mud trees trees falling and taking away
everything said martins who described how he and his father helped rescue
some people as the landslide swamped the area
rio deputy governor luiz fernando pezao said it was vision of horror
describing it to cbn radio as mountain of rocks and trees covering various
homes
nearby houses had been rented out to vacationers for the holiday period
fire chief said the death toll at the hotel site could rise to and rescue
teams were speeding their search saturday amid warnings of the possibility of
new landslides
the whole area is in severe danger of new landslides due to the vegetation
fire department commander pedro machado told globo news
about rescue workers and firefighters aided by rescue dogs wrestled to
remove tons of mud rocks and thick tree trunks in the hope of finding victims
alive on ilha grande but the chances of finding survivors are very slender
machado said
we cannot use heavy equipment because of the risk of setting off new
landslides he said
authorities said most of the bodies recovered earlier were found on land but at
least three had been pulled from the sea
it was not immediately known if there were foreigners among the dead

top brazilian geologist said the natural risk is very severe in locations
like bananal beach where thick vegetation grows in unstable ground on steep
rocky terrain
the occupation of unstable areas is greatly increasing the risk of accidents

the newspaper folha de sao paulo
although the rains stopped on friday authorities put rio on alert because of
fears of potentially devastating mudslides in its densely populated hillside
favelas or shanty towns
about people were reported killed thursday because of subsidence and house
collapses mainly in and around the city
the mudslides have forced people to leave their homes across the state
about the same number affected by similar mudslides which hit the state one year

somali charged with attempt to kill danish cartoonist
copenhagen jan afp
somali man was on saturday charged with the attempted murder of danish
cartoonist whose caricatures of the muslim prophet mohammed sparked riots and
protests around the world
the axe wielding year old broke into kurt westergaard home late friday
screaming for revenge and blood the cartoonist hid in panic room with
five year old granddaughter and called the police
the suspect is alleged to have thrown the axe at one of the policemen who
arrived on the scene just missing him then attacked with knife before being
shot and wounded in the arm and thigh
he was brought bandaged into court at aarhus northwest denmark saturday on
stretcher wearing hospital gown and covered with blankets the ritzau agency
reported
he was charged with double attempted murder court spokesman said adding
the suspect was remanded in custody for four weeks the first two of them in
solitary confinement
the accused who lives near the capital copenhagen but has not been named had
one arm bandaged leg in splint and towel over his face to avoid
identification media reports said while describing him as bearded with
shaved head
denmark pet intelligence agency said he was linked to somalia radical shebab
islamic movement and leaders of al qaeda in east africa although pet chief
jakob scharf later said it appeared he had acted alone
apparently everything indicates he acted alone and maybe had sudden
impulsion several elements of the investigation point towards this theory he
told ritzau
westergaard is one of cartoonists whose drawings on islam were first
published in danish newspaper jyllands posten in september his cartoon
depicted mohammed wearing turban in the shape of bomb
the cartoons were considered offensive by many muslims and their publication
sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february as well as
string of death threats
westergaard was badly shaken by the attack at his home at viby near
aarhus
he described on the jyllands posten website how the attacker smashed the front
door with the axe screaming revenge and blood in poor danish
hid in the secure room when he entered the house knew had no chance of
stopping him so called the police westergaard said
it was horrible the most important thing was that had the reaction to secure
myself but it was close very close
bent preben nielsen chief police inspector for east jutland told afp that
police who went to the scene fired at the aggressor as he threatened them with
the axe and knife hitting him in the hip and the right hand
the person arrested has close links with the somali terrorist organisation
al shebab as well as with the heads of al qaeda in east africa denmark
intelligence service said
he is also suspected of being implicated in terrorist activities when he was in
east africa the individual arrested has also been member of terrorist
network implanted in denmark that has been under surveillance by pet for long
time
somalia radical islamic shebab group hailed the attack
we appreciate the incident in which muslim somali boy attacked the devil who
abused our prophet mohammed and we call upon all muslims around the world to
target the people like him shebab spokesman sheikh ali muhamud rage told afp
in mogadishu
the protests over the cartoons saw demonstrators burn danish flags and torch
danish diplomatic offices in damascus beirut and tehran while dozens of people
died in rioting in nigeria libya and pakistan
two tunisians were arrested in denmark in on suspicion of planning to
murder westergaard but released without trial after they appealed government
order for their expulsion on national security grounds
internet hackers last april attacked website run by denmark free press
society selling prints of westergaard controversial cartoon the group
director lars hedegaard said
despite the hacking hedegaard said close to of the signed prints
had been sold over half of them to foreign buyers for dollars apiece

beat the blues by going to bed early study
new york jan afp
it seems parents have long been right going to bed early is key to getting
enough sleep and helping adolescents feel on top of the world new study
reported
lack of sleep among youngsters may trigger depression and suicidal thoughts
according to the study by the columbia university medical center
our results are consistent with the theory that inadequate sleep is risk
factor for depression working with other risk and protective factors through
multiple possible causal pathways to the development of this mood disorder
said lead author james gangwisch
adequate quality sleep could therefore be preventative measure against
depression and treatment for depression he added in the study published in
the friday issue of sleep magazine
the study followed the nightly habits of some college and high school
students and found those who consistently went to bed after midnight had
percent higher risk of depression than those who turned in before pm
night owls also ran percent higher risk of battling suicidal thoughts the
study added
the american academy of sleep medicine recommends that adolescents should sleep
at least nine hours or more night those who were tucked in before pm
reported they slept on average about eight hours and minutes
but that amount of sleep dropped significantly for those in bed after midnight
and adolescents who slept five hours or less night were percent more likely
to suffer depression and percent more at risk of becoming suicidal the study
said
it is common perception and societal expectation that adolescents do not need
as much sleep as pre adolescents yet studies suggest that adolescents may
actually require more sleep said gangwisch
studies have found that adolescents do not go to bed early enough to compensate
for earlier school start times and transitions to earlier school start times
have been shown to be associated with significant sleep deprivation

football cahill landmark goal helps everton reach fourth round
liverpool england jan afp
australia midfielder tim cahill fired everton into the fa cup fourth round as
his th goal for the club inspired win against carlisle on saturday
david moyes side had struggled to see off their fiesty league one opponents at
goodison park after kevan hurst cancelled out james vaughan early opener for
the hosts
it needed typically predatory finish from cahill who reached his half century
of goals in his nd appearance for the toffees eight minutes from full time
to shatter carlisle resistance before leighton baines put flattering gloss
on the score with late penalty
carlisle were never overawed by their more illustrious opponents and backed by
fans who had braved blizzards to get to merseyside they were unfortunate
not to earn money spinning replay
they got off to the worst possible start when adam clayton careless th
minute back pass presented vaughan with chance to round goalkeeper adam collin
and fire into an empty net
but despite that setback carlisle were level within six minutes as clayton made
amends for his mistake
he drove in long range shot that everton goalkeeper tim howard could only push
out to hurst who turned in the loose ball from yard out
vaughan thought he had restored everton lead when he turned in cahill shot
but his strike was ruled out for offside
young striker vaughan only just back from long term injury went close again
with diving header from baines cross
carlisle were more than holding their own as everton struggled to impose
themselves and the visitors were agonisingly close to taking the lead when
captain danny livesey rattled the bar from yards
just as everton seemed to have run out of ideas they finally took control in
the nd minute
defender seamus coleman on as substitute beat two players on the right and
fired over cross that diniyar bilyaletdinov headed down in the box
cahill saw one shot blocked by ian harte but regained possession to fire past
collin
an injury time penalty from baines after collin had brought down substitute
keiran agard secured everton place in the fourth round
danish cartoonist defiant despite threats
copenhagen jan afp
kurt westergaard has remained defiant in the face of repeated death threats
following his controversial drawing of the prophet mohammed
the danish cartoonist sparked violent protests in the muslim world with
drawing of mohammed wearing turban shaped like bomb published in the
jyllands posten daily newspaper in september
threats to his life forced westergaard to move house repeatedly and both danish
and us authorities have intervened to stop plots to kill him the year old
spent three years in hiding
we have had to move house numerous times and to change car for long time he
told the danish free press society sappho magazine in late saying he
missed his home and his bed
in he returned home to the town of aarhus in central denmark thinking the
threats against him were at an end
on friday year old somali man armed with an axe and knife broke into the
cartoonist home which is under police guard night and day screaming for
revenge and blood
westergaard survived by hiding in panic room with his five year old
granddaughter and calling the police
past attempts on his life have not intimidated the cartoonist
they can threaten me but they will not make me give in he told the sappho
magazine in october
am not afraid but am angry at being subjected to threats just for doing my
job he said adding that anger helped him overcome fear
friends say that during his year career as an artist westergaard former
german teacher has been known for his vivid and at times provocative
imagination
his drawing of mohammed completely changed his life to his great surprise
never imagined these cartoons would cause such storm he said during
debate on danish television in september pointing out that his drawing was
not directed against islam itself
but freedom of expression includes disrespect which can be hurtful and
offensive he said
the danish free press society awarded him its sappo prize in in recognition
of his courage and his unbending defence of free speech the right to criticise
religion and fundamental danish freedoms
