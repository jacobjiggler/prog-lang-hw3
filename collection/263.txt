earlier in the day man as roma moved up to fourth and the final champions
league qualification position with home success against woeful chievo

they trailed with just two minutes remaining
but dutch playmaker wesley sneijder curled home his second free kick of the game
and then three minutes into injury time substitute walter samuel crashed home
the winner to send the inter faithful wild
it was rough luck on the serie basement sitters who fully deserved something
from thrilling match
even without algeria forward abdul kader ghezzal siena gave good account of
themselves from the off
macedonia forward goran pandev on his home debut for inter had the first clear
sight of goal on eight minutes and after jinking in from the right side of the
box his low left foot shot was tipped around the post by goalkeeper gianluca
curci
the visitors then stunned their hosts on minutes as former middlesbrough
forward massimo maccarone ran unchallenged from the halfway line before smacking
yard screamer past julio cesar despairing dive into the top corner
inter response was rapid as brazil right back maicon stormed forward and shot
wide from just outside the area
three minutes later though diego milito equalised after running onto
sneijder long ball cutting inside sanchez cribari with embarrassing ease and
curling the ball around curci
full normality seemed to have been restored on minutes when sneijder scored
his first free kick from yards but seconds later siena equalised
reginaldo turned inter captain javier zanetti easily out on the right flank and
his cross was missed by all until swede albin ekdal arrived at the back post to
slip the ball under julio cesar
shock was then truly on the cards minutes into the second half as maccarone
bagged his second as he beat julio cesar at the near post after arriving
unmarked on the edge of the box to meet reginaldo pull back
but two minutes from the end sneijder hit yard special and then samuel
playing at left back but thrown forward for the final moments turned on the
edge of the box to shoot left footed in off the far post
inter main rivals juventus and ac milan will try to limit their losses as they

scored the only goal of the game in the opening minute with former italy
striker luca toni making his debut following his loan move from bayern munich
coach claudio ranieri paid tribute to his new striker who was only replaced
late on due to tiredness
hoped that toni would be as ready as this for the commitment of match he
played well and was great help to us he said
with against he would have run less but even so he managed to keep us
high up the pitch he created the chance for penalty he fought hard and won
many battles
toni had great chance to open his account on five minutes but flicked rodrigo
taddei inch perfect cross wide of the near post
roma seemed to have shot themselves in the foot on minutes when goalkeeper
doni came charging out of his box and blocked elvis abbruscato chip with his
arm earning straight red card
even so the visitors created little and things could have been worse but for
