rugbyu tuqiri at the double as tigers swot wasps
london jan afp
lote tuqiri scored his first tries for leicester as the tigers thrashed wasps
to move to the top of the english premier league table on saturday
tuqiri former australia international in both league and union joined the
tigers in november after an alleged code of conduct breach put paid to his
cap career with the wallabies which yielded test tries
the dynamic back scored twice in the second half as leicester who cleared
more than tonnes of snow from their welford road ground pulled clear from
their old rivals in the only one of this weekend premiership matches to
survive the big freeze engulfing britain
playing behind pack like ours is sensational and it was tremendous to get
the tries after being here for seven weeks tuqiri said
this is one great club and already having good time even with this
weather he added
leicester were behind shortly before the break following an early try from
mark van gisbergen and danny cipriani penalty
but they hit back on the stroke of half time through johne murphy try
converted by toby flood
then came tuqiri double and penalty try with england fly half flood kicking
points in all in match where leicester victory was built on dominant
display at the scrum
am so proud because we ve beaten very fine team after working so hard all
week to get the game on said leicester coach richard cockerill
on average we do scrums week but ve played in france and we have
some argentine guys here so our scrummaging experience is good the former
england front row added
meanwhile cockerill wasps counterpart tony hanks was happy with the display of
danny cipriani out of favour with england manager martin johnson in the
talented back preferred position of fly half even though the playmaker spurned
kick at goal which could have extended the visitors lead
was pleased with danny cipriani performance at fly half said hanks
he is back to good form and while it was bit ambitious not taking that
penalty in the first half when we led that is now the reason we go home
empty handed
worryingly for england ahead of johnson announcement next week of his squad
for the upcoming six nations wasps veteran test lock simon shaw suffered
knee injury
simon shaw suffered hyper expansion of the knee so we took him off as
precaution hanks explained

tennis nadal shocked by mr invisible davydenko again
doha jan afp
rafael nadal who not so long ago was dominating the men tour is still
without title for more than eight months and one week after an astonishing
defeat in the final of the qatar open here on saturday
nadal failed to convert two second set match points in
loss to nikolay davydenko known as mr invisible which will once again
raise the question whether he has the confidence to fight his way back to the
pinnacle
little more than week before he begins the defence of his australian open
title nadal also let slip final set lead and retreated into more
defensive and containing patterns which contributed significantly to the
courageous davydenko revival
in this tournament came back to play my best tennis for long time claimed
nadal making the best of his disappointment
anyway lost today saturday he played unbelievable tennis he was just
better
for three quarters of an hour this had looked impossible
during that phase the russian began uncertainly nadal imposed flatter
hitting earlier taken more enterprising attack which he had been employing
previously this week and had romped through seven games without reply
when davydenko began to play more as he had against roger federer in the semi
finals taking the initiative wherever possible hitting stridently and if
necessary finishing the rally in the forecourt nadal fought back aggressively
from down and looked odds on to close the match out in the tie break
on one of his match points at davydenko played just too well but on the
second at nadal earned himself relatively pressure free hit on the
forehand from inside the baseline and unaccountably put it into the net
once he had also let slip an early break of serve in the final set nadal lack
of confidence born from injury long sequence without title and doubts
about his future began to reveal itself
he retreated more often into what he knew best the style in which he contains
his opponent attacks from several feet behind the baseline relying on
mobility tenacity and change of paced winners from counter hitting positions
but on hard courts that can be risky ploy against so fine striker of the
ball as davydenko who had the ability to fashion quick winners from either wing
and to apply finishing volley confidently when required
he had after all won the last four of their previous meetings on this surface
by the second half of the final set he was more often dominating the rallies and
dfter two hours and minutes of battling it no longer seemed surprise when
his turn around was complete
was just fighting never thought about winning didn think could
win claimed davydenko though this seemed more like his professional
psychology for taking each point as it came along
for every point was fighting and at the end it was just amazing
it made the man who has become known as mr invisible for having so low public
profile only the second player to beat both federer and nadal in the same
tournament twice the other is david nalbandian of argentina
it also raised the question now that he has his th title including the atp
world tour masters in london at the end of the season whether he can also
take away nadal australian open title
for three sets it really interesting davydenko answered predictably trying
to downplay his chances
there it will be five sets it different conditions here it degrees
cold and there it can be degrees
it ought to be the same but when you get there it always feels different but
have confidence so we will see

disgraced wife of ireland first minister to resign party
belfast jan afp
the disgraced politician wife of northern ireland first minister peter
robinson has been dumped by her party sources said saturday as her husband
faced calls to resign
her husband democratic unionist party dup has terminated the membership of
iris robinson over her financial dealings with teenage lover
she will vacate her seats in the british parliament and in the northern ireland
assembly next week dup officials told the bbc and the press association news
agency
party source said the next few days is absolutely critical for the party we
wanted to show people we were acting decisively
there was no question about it she had to go and go now there was absolutely
no sympathy for the position she found herself in
iris robinson had already announced she was quitting politics because of severe
depression
she and her husband have become embroiled in crisis after it emerged that she
had secured pounds euros dollars from two wealthy
developers to help her then year old lover set up restaurant in belfast
peter robinson has insisted he knew nothing of his wife financial dealings and
has vowed to clear his name but he is facing growing calls to resign or
consider his future amid deep disquiet within the dup
it is alleged he failed to alert the authorities that his wife did not declare
her monetary interest in her lover business even though she was member of
the council which gave him the go ahead to open in
the free presbyterian church which is closely linked to the protestant dup
offered peter robinson little comfort when senior minister urged him to step
down as first minister
do believe that his position is becoming increasingly untenable said
reverend david mcilveen
judgments that we make in private will undoubtedly influence our judgements in
public mcilveen said
the scandal comes as tensions run high between the pro british dup and its
partners in the power sharing government in belfast sinn fein who want
united ireland
protestant conservative unionists the dup and catholic socialist republicans
sinn fein have shared power since but concern over return to violence
was fuelled by the death of two british soldiers and policeman in attacks by
dissident republicans last year
fresh fears of violence were raised on friday when catholic police officer was
seriously injured after bomb exploded under his car as he was driving to work
he remains in critical condition

football four star atletico get recre loss out of their system
madrid jan afp
atletico madrid put their midweek kings cup shambles behind them with
convincing win at valladolid on saturday to appease their disgruntled fans
with second successive league win
coach quique sanchez flores was seething after atletico first leg cup loss
to second division recreativo huelva on wednesday and read the riot act to his
players and they responded by blitzing valladolid
goals from jose jurado diego forlan jose antonio reyes and substitute sergio
kun aguero secured atletico first win at valladolid since although they
stay in th position points off the desired champions league places
flores dropped argentine forward aguero to the substitutes bench while czech
centre back tomas ujfalusi was suspended after his sending off in the recre
disaster
with minutes gone atletico took the lead with reyes coming from deep on the
left before cutting the ball back for jurado to convert
flores was out of the dug out punching his fist in delight and the second goal
came on minutes through forlan
the uruguayan showed great strength to shrug off his marker and finished with
aplomb as valladolid were undone on the counter attack again
it has been tough season for forlan and this was his first league goal since
the beginning of december and only his fifth of the season compared with the
he plundered last season to collect the pichichi crown for the league top
scorer
close to the hour mark reyes wrapped up the game with an impressive drilled
volley into the bottom corner for his first goal of the campaign
valladolid should have had penalty on minutes but instead marquitos barreno
was booked for diving to infuriate the home crowd
aguero made it four in the final minute to cap miserable night for valladolid
who hover three points above the relegation zone
