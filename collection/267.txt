unmis sent team of peacekeepers to defuse tensions and help prevent reprisal
attacks in warrap he said
the team also has representatives of humanitarian agencies to initiate
humanitarian needs assessment on the ground especially for those who have
been displaced due to the violence he said
thousands have been reportedly displaced but these figures as well as those
concerning the victims of the attacks still need to be verified

their homes
the aid groups urged the un security council to ensure that civilian protection
becomes priority of unmis peacekeepers warning that growing frustration over
the lack of development was undermining peace

help goss the government of southern sudan deal with the rising violence in

football rosicky rides to arsenal rescue
london jan afp
tomas rosicky stoppage time leveller rescued point for title chasing arsenal
in their english premier league draw at home to everton on saturday
everton were on course for shock victory after south african midfielder steven
pienaar scored brilliant goal to put the visitors who kicked off four points
above the relegation zone up with nine minutes left
but there was still time for czech midfielder rosicky to equalise after his shot
looped off australian defender lucas neill and over united states international
goalkeeper tim howard
arsenal both of whose goals came via deflections would have gone into second
place if they won but the draw left them in third place three points adrift
of leaders and london rivals chelsea
reigning champions manchester united will go top if they win away to birmingham
in saturday late match
in one of only two of the weekend nine premier league matches to survive the
freezing conditions sweeping britain everton took th minute lead when
midfielder leon osman headed in corner from on loan united states
international landon donovan making his debut for the merseysiders
but the gunners were level at snow covered emirates stadium before the half
hour mark when denilson shot deflected off osman
then in the st minute australia tim cahill held the ball up and released
pienaar who strode through before cheekily lofting shot over arsenal
goalkeeper manuel almunia
arsenal manager arsene wenger admitted his side still without injured captain
cesc fabregas had been fortunate to come away with point
we played against very good everton team who for most of the game was more
dangerous and sharper than us he said
at the end of the day we dropped two points but looking at the game we gained
one point because we were closer to losing the game than to winning it
we got the point because we had the spirit and the desire but we didn find
our game today
everton boss david moyes was in no doubt his side thrashed by arsenal on
the opening day of the season should have come away with victory
we were up into injury time it should have been our day we deserved to
win today moyes told sky sports
we played well enough created enough chances and we should be coming away with
three points
earlier wigan match against aston villa was the only one of the seven premier
league matches postponed this weekend to be called off because of frozen
pitch the others falling victim to concerns about spectator safety on icy roads
surrounding grounds

football ten man roma beat chievo to go fourth
rome jan afp
as roma survived the th minute sending off of goalkeeper doni to beat woeful
chievo and move up to fourth in serie on saturday
daniele de rossi scored the only goal of the game in the opening minute as
former italy striker luca toni made his debut following his loan move from
bayern munich
but that roma managed to dominate match in which they played almost minutes
with numerical disadvantage said more about chievo ineptitude than their own
ability
they were off to flying start as de rossi headed home david pizarro corner
in the first minute
four minutes later toni should have opened his roma account but he flicked
rodrigo taddei inch perfect cross wide of the near post when it seemed easier
to hit the target
roma seemed to have shot themselves in the foot on minutes when centre backs
juan and nicolas burdisso left gaping hole for elvis abbruscato to steam
through onto luca rigoni through ball
doni who was only in the side after julio sergio was ruled out just before
kick off came charging out of his box and blocked abbruscato chip with his
arm earning straight red card
even so the visitors created little and de rossi curled free kick inches past
the post on minutes while three minutes later toni failed to get touch on
john arne riise fizzing volleyed cross from just few yards out
riise then teed up taddei on minutes but the brazilian bundled his back post
volley wide
ten minutes after the restart toni won his side penalty after crumpling in the
box under minimal pressure from davide mandelli but justice was served when
stefano sorrentino saved pizarro spot kick
still roma looked the more likely winners as marco cassetti met taddei cross
two yards from goal at the back post on minutes but as he stooped to head
the ball it dipped under his head and hit his chest before dribbling wide
champions and leaders inter milan were due to host basement sitters siena in the
day late game knowing victory would take them points clear at the top
for hours at least

togo pulls out of nations cup after gun attack
luanda jan afp
togo pulled out of the african nations cup on saturday after at least two people
were killed in rebel ambush on its squad convoy despite angola efforts to
allay security concerns ahead of kick off
the togolese government has decided to recall its team togolese government
spokesman pascal bodjona said
we cannot in such dramatic circumstance continue the african nations cup
competition this is necessary because the players are in shock
togo assistant coach and its squad spokesman died friday after hooded gunmen
opened fire as the team buses crossed into the restive angolan enclave of
cabinda according to the confederation of african football caf
the attack was claimed by separatist group embroiled in struggle for
independence in the oil rich territory
prime minister paulo kassoma met with confederation of african football
president issa haytou in luanda to reassure player safety ahead of the opening
match of africa largest football festival on sunday
the prime minister considers the incident in cabinda as an isolated act and
repeated that the security of togo team and the other squads is guaranteed
his office said in statement
it added that victims of the attack have received the best medical care
football teams competing in the day tournament nonetheless expressed deep
unease about the shooting but backed the decision to continue
officials were in cabinda on saturday to review security and investigate the
attack which was initially reported to have wounded nine in the togo squad
including two players
caf official kodjo samlan said earlier reports that one of the bus drivers had
been killed were incorrect
players and others on board fearing for their lives cowered under seats for
minutes to escape the hail of bullets squad member thomas dossevi said they had
been fired on like dogs
we are all little shocked and we re asking why caf the competition
organisers were holding games in cabinda how can you organise tournament in
state of war dossevi told afp saturday
on saturday evening goalkeeper kodjovi obilale was in stable condition in
johannesburg hospital where he was expected to undergo surgery after being
airlifted to south africa
he is conscious and in stable condition he has suffered two gunshoot wounds
to the lower back and abdomen said doctor richard friedland head of the
private milpark hospital where the year old was admitted
organisers said the games would proceed as planned
caf is continuing with its schedule and the sovereign authorities of the
country angola are taking the adequate measures surrounding security said
constant omari member of the local organising committee
togo and aston villa midfielder moustapha salifou one of two english
premiership players who were uninjured told his club website that team would
seek permission from the togo and african officials to leave the tournament
no one wants to play we just want to go home he said we have made our
decision as players we can play in these circumstances and we want to leave
for home today
the armed wing of the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda which
wants for independence for cabinda which is physically split from the rest of
angola by strip of the democratic republic of congo claimed responsibility
for the attack
this operation is only the start of series of targeted actions it warned on
friday
caf spokesman souleymane habuba questioned why togo opted to travel by road
caf regulations are clear teams are required to fly rather than travel by
bus he said adding our great concern is for the players but the
championship goes ahead
cia director defends agency against criticism
washington jan afp
us central intelligence agency director leon panetta on saturday defended the us
spy service against criticism following suicide bombing in afghanistan in
which seven cia operatives were killed
as an agency we have found consolation in the strength and heroism of our
fallen colleagues and their families panetta wrote in an op ed piece in the
washington post
we have found no consolation however in public commentary suggesting that
those who gave their lives somehow brought it upon themselves because of poor
tradecraft
jordanian doctor said to have been triple agent blew himself up at us
military base in khost near the pakistani border on december the deadliest
attack against the cia since
in an account of the attack based on interviews with cia operatives who were at
the scene the post said the doctor humam khalil abu mulal al balawi detonated
suicide bomb just before he was to be patted down
practically everyone within sight of the bomber died instantly when thousands of
steel pellets explode from the device and at least six others including the
cia second in command within afghanistan were wounded
the cia had been planning to speak with the doctor about ways to kill ayman al
zawahiri al qaeda number two leader
the post citing unnamed cia and intelligence sources said the americans
principal mistake was trusting the doctor who had never visited the front line
base
somebody comes and it like celebration that they re coming it good to
make them feel welcome it good to make them feel important former cia
field officer told the newspaper
the jordanian was heralded as superstar asset so you get an important
visitor coming so you go out and meet him is it bad tradecraft of course
panetta said the criticism of poor tradecraft was akin to suggesting that us
marines who die in firefight had brought it upon themselves because they have
poor war fighting skills
this was not question of trusting potential intelligence asset even one
who had provided information that we could verify independently panetta went
on to say
it is never that simple and no one ignored the hazards the individual was
about to be searched by our security officers distance away from other
intelligence personnel when he set off his explosives
the al qaeda network hailed the suicide bombing that killed seven cia agents in
afghanistan as revenge for the deaths of top militants in us drone strikes in
pakistan
rallying coma denies cheating after big time penalty for tyre change
antofagasta chile jan afp
spanish ktm rider marc coma top challenger for the dakar rally title
protested his innocence on saturday after being handed six hour penalty by
organisers for an illegal tyre change during the previous day seventh stage
noting the stop he made behind house and the images we have thanks to google
which show exactly where he stopped and for how long coupled with today high
definition images of the tyre these images are clear the tyre did not do
km said moto course director marc ducrocq
the decision has therefore been taken by the organisers to hand him six hour
penalty
everyone knew that he had tyre problems he tried to sort it out in his own way
and he was caught said ducrocq who added that the spanish rider continues to
insist that he did not change wheel
coma the dakar motorcycle winner in and denied any wrongdoing
consider this decision an injustice at no time can it be proved that
changed wheel said coma adding that he would take day to consider whether
to continue on in the race
it depends bit on the mental state in which find myself
the penalty effectively leaves fellow ktm rider cyril despres almost certain to
claim the title as he was already just over an hour clear of his spanish rival
having just edged him by sec on the day
third placed helder rodrigues of portugal on yamaha is adrift
minutes more than coma had been and norwegian ktm racer pal ullevalseter is
five minutes further back
saturday is rest day before the km adventure resumes on sunday with
km special stage from antofagasta to copiapo

football aberdeen shatter hearts cup hopes
glasgow jan afp
aberdeen moved into the scottish cup fifth round with clinical win over
hearts on saturday
goals from darren mackie and lee miller in the second half at pittodrie were
enough to seal the victory for mark mcghee side and end hearts five match
unbeaten run
it was aberdeen first home win since november and they were rarely troubled by
lacklustre hearts team
mackie broke the deadlock in the th minute with his first goal for the dons
since february
peter pawlett released lee miller with an intelligent pass and the striker
clipped the ball past the onrushing marian kello for mackie to shoot home
chris maguire who had come on as replacement for paul marshall just minutes
earlier created aberdeen second when his deep cross to the far post was
slotted home by miller in the th minute
although mcghee was delighted to see mackie end his goal drought the dons boss
admitted he had been hoping for the match to be called off because so many of
his defenders were injured and suspended
mcghee said spent friday night waking up every two hours almost wishing for
snow because thought that was going to be without maurice ross and charlie
mulgrew as well as andrew considine
but last week darren led the line on his own brilliantly at dundee united and
he carried on his work rate here
he is player who comes under pressure from the home fans but got the
feeling that everyone was pleased for him certainly hope he gets another one
before next year
hearts manager csaba laszlo added we weren very lucky in the draw to get
aberdeen away from home and we also had the problem of missing several key
players
am not angry at my young players as they tried their best but this is not
enough
they must also show the will and the fighting spirit but this is good
learning process for them this was very painful defeat
there is film with tom cruise called mission impossible try to make it
possible
as long as feel have the power stay positive and keep fighting
the pittodrie clash was one of only five cup fixtures to survive the snowy
conditions in scotland
celtic clash at morton was postponed as were nine other matches including
kilmarnock falkirk and inverness motherwell rangers trip to hamilton on
sunday is still scheduled to go ahead
in the other matches that beat the freeze hibernian avoided shock as they
cruised past irvine meadow at easter road
irvine who beat arbroath in november to set up the first ever cup clash between
an spl and junior level side hadn played competitive match for more than
month
it showed as derek riordan put hibs ahead in the nd minute when his shot
deflected in off alexander ryan
merouane zemmama increased hibernian lead in the nd minute before paul
hanlon added the third goal in the th minute
irvine chief chris strain saluted his side effort and said the boys will now
look at that and say we could maybe take step up
hibs boss john hughes added junior sides are always well organised resolute
they were flying the flag for the juniors they were competing very well their
supporters were fantastic and they made right good game of it
let give them all the credit we were on hiding to nothing
elsewhere dundee united won at partick thanks to goals from damian
