there was no excuse however for the rank bad defending that allowed everton to
take the lead after just minutes
donovan swung in routine corner from the right and osman one of the smallest
players on the pitch was allowed to run from deep and jump unhindered to head
the ball past manuel almunia
everton were good value for the lead with arsenal struggling to create an
opening of note
but wenger men were given route back into the game in the th minute
courtesy of fortunate deflection after donovan failure to clear from his own
area
the ball fell to andrey arshavin and made its way to denilson via eduardo and
the brazilian shot flew past the wrong footed howard after catching the back
of osman legs
arsenal were lucky to be on level terms but everton should have soon been ahead
again when cahill found space between bacary sagna and william gallas at the far
post but was caught in two minds and wasted the headed chance
the pattern of the game was maintained in the second half with everton
defending becoming more impressive as arsenal sought winning goal
by contrast the home side backline looked increasingly fragile and they were
completely caught out by cahill st minute pass that released pienaar who
ran yards before lifting the ball over almunia

match because he seemed to return everything had
but am glad kept the pressure on till the end and won it was good win
