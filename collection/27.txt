coordination the foreign armada has thwarted many attacks and captured dozens
of pirates generally equipped with rudimentary skiffs

football benjani keeps mancini run going in cup win
middlesbrough england jan afp
benjani mwaruwari struck for the first time in more than year to maintain new
manchester city manager roberto mancini percent record with fa cup
win at middlesbrough
the zimbabwe international made the most of rare start with his first goal of
the season to seal city progress to the fourth round at the expense of their
second tier championship hosts who have not prospered since gordon strachan
replaced gareth southgate earlier this season this was their seventh defeat in
his matches in charge
benjani whose last goal came in premier league draw against fulham in
december pounced from the edge of the area in first half stoppage time
after powerful run from his own half by martin petrov to give italian boss
mancini reminder of his abilities
victory stretched city combined run under mancini and sacked predecessor mark
hughes to just single defeat in games
city will hope to emulate the last five clubs to beat boro in this competition
who ve gone on to make the final although mancini will hope to go one better as
all five have ended as runners up
the pitch passed late inspection in near blizzard snow conditions which kept
the crowd to just as several coachloads of city fans were turned back en
route due to the extreme weather conditions
mancini was able to leave more than million pounds worth of talent on the
city bench as he made five changes from the team which beat wolves in their
most recent premier league fixture
the italian rested carlos tevez gareth barry and craig bellamy ahead of the
league cup semi final first leg meeting with manchester united on wednesday
all three came on in the second half to help city secure only their first win on
teesside in years
mancini selection policy meant first start for dedryck boyata the belgian
teenager who partnered micah richards at centre back with benjani employed as
lone forward
the impressive petrov was at the heart of the few first half openings carved out
by the visitors as pablo zabaleta forced fine save from middlesbrough
goalkeeper danny coyne before petrov curled an effort narrowly wide from the
edge of the area
middlesbrough beat city years ago en route to the fa cup final but once they
lost influential england under midfielder adam johnson to an early recurrence
of hamstring problem they showed little indication of improving on run of
just two wins from games under new manager gordon strachan
gary neil had penalty claims when he went down under challenge from sylvinho
just after the break but well placed referee stuart attwell correctly booked
the boro captain for diving
city failed to impose themselves on the contest after the break despite the
introduction at half time of tevez and barry and rhys williams went close with
header onto the roof of the net from tony mcmahon cross as boro went in
search of an equaliser
but shay given was rarely tested and the city goalkeeper had little trouble in
clinching third straight clean sheet under mancini
bellamy went close to doubling the lead late on as the wales international
forced great save from coyne

the stroke of half time from kevin prince boateng to salvage replay for the
beleaguered hosts
crowd of just watched as portsmouth who won the fa cup in failed
to make the most of bright start
tommy smith tested sky blues goalkeeper keiren westwood after just three
minutes then frederic piquionne shot across the face of goal
coventry gradually grew in confidence though and chris coleman side took the
lead in the th minute when bell lashed long range effort past asmir begovic
portsmouth supporters began to show their frustration with chants of where
have your wages gone and grant men finally showed enough energy to get back
in the match
they almost equalised when westwood made fine stop to deny piquionne from
smith cross
and boateng made sure piquionne wouldn regret that miss when he headed in
richard hughes cross in the th minute
coventry suffered blow at the break when the injured westwood was forced to
come off but portsmouth couldn find way past substitute stopper dimitrios
konstantopoulos
konstantopoulos made fine close range save when boateng chased down michael
brown pass and turned to shoot sharply at the greek
john utaka was picked out by superb sweeping ball from younes kaboul after
minutes but despite controlling the pass beautifully konstantopoulos kept his
curling effort out with an impressive save
pompey looked stronger in the closing stages but konstantopoulos secured
replay with excellent late stops from utaka and smith

iran nuclear ultimatum changes nothing germany
berlin jan afp
germany said saturday that iran ultimatum for the west to accept uranium
swap deal within month or else it would produce its own nuclear fuel for
reactor changed nothing
iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki issued the challenge on saturday
state television reported
the situation has not changed germany foreign ministry spokesman told afp
the proposal of the international community remains valid iran must seize this
opportunity
the un nuclear watchdog the international atomic energy agency iaea had
proposed that iran ship most of its low enriched uranium to russia and france
for processing into fuel for the research reactor
but tehran rejected december deadline to accept this risking new un
sanctions
on tuesday it said however it was ready to swap abroad its low enriched uranium
for nuclear fuel while insisting the exchange happen in stages
world powers suspect that iran wants to produce uranium for military purposes
despite repeated denials from tehran
iran is already under three sets of un sanctions for refusing to abandon its
sensitive programme of uranium enrichment the process which produces nuclear
fuel or in highly extended form the fissile core of an atomic bomb
