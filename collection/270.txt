germany needs big spending cuts to reduce deficit minister
berlin jan afp
germany finance minister wolfgang schaeuble says the centre right government
faces the colossal task of making major spending cuts to reduce the public
deficit starting in
germany budget foresees record billion euros billion
dollars in public debt and the government will need to start preparing the
citizens for spending cuts to take effect next year said schaeuble in an
interview with the tagesspiegel am sonntag newspaper to be published sunday
chancellor angela merkel coalition of the christian democrat bloc and the
business friendly free democrats formed after victory in september polls
must deal with this colossal task which will call for lot of political
agreement schaeuble added
the government expects the economy to grow percent this year after slumping
around five percent in in the worst decline since world war ii
stimulating growth in europe biggest economy has been one the most contentious
issues for the new coalition with experts saying the country can ill afford
proposed further tax cuts
the conservative merkel only narrowly succeeded in december to push through the
upper house of parliament first wave of tax cuts worth billion euros
to help pull germany out of recession the government had decided to allow the
deficit to grow in the short term mainly by lowering taxes
schaeuble said the measures taken to reduce the deficit will depend in part on
how the economy is doing by may and on other hand what spending cuts the
coalition is prepared to make
he added everyone needs to realise that we can only stimulate growth with
lower taxes if at the same time we reduce spending
schaeuble also said germany aims to bring the public deficit below the eurozone
limit of three percent of gross domestic product by
meanwhile the newsmagazine der spiegel has reported the finance minister plans
to delay the anticipated fiscal reforms until after
