ankara jan afp
turkish first division side kayserispor said saturday that it had suspended
midfielder bilal aziz ozer after newspaper report implicated him in the match

unfortunately our player bilal aziz has been accused of manipulating match
against eskisehirspor we won the said match with goal assisted by the said
player the club said in brief statement on its website

rumours it added
the announcement came after the milliyet newspaper published report filed with
german prosecutors investigating the scandal that named ozer as one of three
kayserispor players that tried to fix the october league match against
eskisehirspor
the report based on tapped phone conversations between ozer and member of the
match fixing gang show that the three players had agreed to ensure that their
club would lose the game
but when kayserispor won the gang member warns aziz and his clubmates to
pay for the loss or face the consequences even at one point threatening them
with death
aziz never reveals the identities of his two clubmates despite insistent
questions by gang member the document said
in november german prosecutors announced that strong band had been
rigging games in germany belgium croatia slovenia turkey hungary bosnia
hercegovina and austria and switzerland
by bribing players coaches referees and officials to influence matches the
gang is thought to have earned as much as million euros in huge bets with
bookmakers in europe and asia primarily in china
among those matches are games in turkey from the first division
downwards
the turkish football federation said in november that it asked german
prosecutors for copy of their findings to make its own evaluation

rugbyu munster match falls victim to weather
london jan afp
irish province munster celtic league match against welsh region the scarlets
was called off on saturday day before sunday kick off due to the freezing
weather sweeping britain and ireland
the pitch at leinster musgrave park ground in cork had been covered with
warm air blanket since friday morning
but overnight temperatures dropped to minus nine degrees celsius and officials
said further deteoriation was expected later saturday
munster chief executive garrett fitzgerald said while our inspection this
morning showed part of the pitch unplayable the continuing use of the warm air
blanket would in our opinion have left the pitch playable by pm gmt
tomorrow sunday if conditions remained as they are now
however given the forecast of lower temperatures and snow overnight we felt
it would be unfair to those travelling or planning to travel to leave final
decision until the morning and have therefore abandoned the idea of playing the
game
munster decision meant the only one of this weekend five celtic league
matches to have as yet survived the weather was saturday late kick off
between edinburgh and cardiff blues

obama promises changes in us health care this year
washington jan afp
us president barack obama promised saturday that americans will see the effects
of health reform this year saying congress is on the verge of approving the
overhaul the nation health care system
now it ll take few years to fully implement these reforms in responsible
way obama said in his weekly radio address
but what every american should know is that once sign health insurance reform
into law there are dozens of protections and benefits that will take effect
this year
the us house of representatives and senate both passed sweeping health reform
proposals last year but their bills differ significantly
both measures aim to extend health care coverage to more than million out of
the million americans that lack it end abusive health insurance company
practices and curb soaring costs that take giant bites out of family and
government budgets
but the senate stripped out government backed public option plan to compete
with private insurers in order to win over the backing of handful of centrist
democrats without whom the bill would not have secured the votes needed to
pass in the seat body
the two versions of the plan will now have to be reconciled before final
approval
there are still disputes over how to pay for the plan and whether the overhaul
should create national exchange where americans could buy coverage or set
up exchanges on state by state basis
but obama expressed confidence that lawmakers were on the verge of passing
health insurance reform that will finally offer americans the security of
knowing they ll have quality affordable health care whether they lose their
job change jobs move or get sick
he said that after his signed the proposal into law uninsured americans with
pre existing illness or condition will be able to purchase coverage they can
afford
children with pre existing conditions the president added will no longer be
refused coverage and small business owners who can afford to cover their
employees will be immediately offered tax credits to purchase coverage
according to obama insurance companies will be required to offer free
preventive care to their customers
all told these changes represent the most sweeping reforms and toughest
restrictions on insurance companies that this country has ever known the
president concluded
that how we ll make healthier and more secure year for every american
for those who have health insurance and those who don
the united states is the world richest nation but the only industrialized
democracy that does not provide health care coverage to all of its citizens
as nation the united states spends more than double what britain france and
germany do per person on health care
but it lags behind other countries in life expectancy and infant mortality
according to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd
the legislation would shave an estimated billion dollars from the soaring us
budget deficit while aiming to ban abusive health insurance practices and
curbing skyrocketing us medical costs
christian villagers furious after egypt arson attacks
bahgura egypt jan afp
residents of southern egypt village were furious on saturday after houses and
shops owned by coptic christians were burnt as sectarian tensions flared in the
wake of deadly drive by shooting
muslim gunmen shot dead six copts in the nearby town of nagaa hammadi on
wednesday night as worshippers emerged from christmas eve mass one of egypt
deadliest sectarian attacks in years in which policeman was also killed
three people have now been charged in connection with the attack
on saturday men in traditional flowing robes and with crosses tattooed on their
arms surveyed the damage in bahgura where shopfronts that were once blue and
green were now charred black after overnight arson attacks
they charged that muslim thugs who live in the town went on the rampage on
friday night lobbing fireballs into christian owned shops and some houses
muslim residents said the action was in retaliation for the shooting death of
member of their community while christian villagers said woman from their
community had died in fire attacks on their property
security sources denied there had been any deaths
past sugarcane fields lining the nile riot police and plain clothed officers
guarded the entrances to villages and towns near nagaa hammadi in impoverished
qena province which relies entirely on sugar production
in bahgura crowd of villagers vented their anger to plain clothes
policeman and at least one person lunged forward in an attempt to hit him
before being restrained by other residents
you don want the truth to come out you don want them to see what
happened one man shouted as police asked reporters to leave town
christian homes and shops were burned by muslims the villagers charged
they are muslims and they live in this village one man said
what can we do they are protected and we are not shouted another
christians in bahgura and in nagaa hammadi where the christmas eve killings
took place are convinced that the authorities are turning blind eye to the
sectarian violence
some even accuse the authorities of actively protecting muslims they say are
behind the simmering tensions
however on saturday judicial source said the prosecutor in north qena has
charged three suspects with premeditated murder putting the life of citizens
in danger and damage to public and private property
the interior ministry on friday announced the capture of three suspects from
wednesday shooting including nagaa hammadi resident mohammed al kamuni known
locally by his nickname hamam
but the ministry announcement merely left copts demanding more answers
we all know hamam one christian resident of nagaa hammadi told afp he
hired thug we want to know who is really behind the shooting
the nagaa hammadi attack was the deadliest since copts were killed in
sectarian clashes in also in southern egypt
copts who account for nearly percent of egypt population of million
are the middle east largest christian community but complain of routine
harassment and systematic discrimination and marginalisation
in the aftermath of the nagaa hammadi killings many copts fear new outbreak
of violence and are unwilling to tone down their anger at what they say is
government attempt to hush up egypt sectarian problem
the only reason things remain quiet is because of the heavy hand of security
remove that hand and things will blow up malaak told afp declining to
give her surname
another christian who also asked not to be identified said the problem
between muslims and christians is huge and the police security and politicians
are all involved
since the christmas eve attack there has been further sporadic unrest in nagaa
hammadi bahgura and in the nearby mixed hamlet of ezbet tarka
in cairo on saturday around people staged demonstration against the
sectarian clashes in the south with placards denouncing the shocking silence
of the authorities and demanding security for all egyptians
judicial source said group of copts muslims and opposition kefaya members
had also filed an official complaint against the security services accusing
them of failing to protect religious buildings

palestinians snub us call demand full settlement freeze
ramallah west bank jan afp
the palestinians on saturday insisted on full israeli settlement freeze before
renewing peace efforts putting damper on us call to revive talks with no
preconditions
resumption of peace talks requires the complete halt of settlements in the
occupied west bank chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told afp
erakat also demanded that israel comply with its commitment under the
international roadmap for peace that calls for halt to all settlement
activity including natural growth and jerusalem
negotiations should be picked up from the point they were left when they broke
down in december he said
so far there has been no reaction from the israeli government
on friday us secretary of state hillary clinton urged israelis and palestinians
to resume the peace talks without preconditions in washington latest bid to
return the sides to the negotiations table
clinton backed the key palestinian aim of creating state along the borders
that existed before the israeli arab war but said the lines would be
modified through mutually agreed land swaps presumably to account for some
israeli settlements that would remain
the palestinian stand was backed by the foreign ministers of saudi arabia and
germany who met in riyadh on saturday
the illegal settlements constitute major obstacle to peace talks saudi
foreign minister prince saud al faisal said in joint news conference with his
german counterpart guido westerwelle
westerwelle said settlement freeze was part of the roadmap this is also
the position expressed by the european union as whole he said
the palestinians have insisted the borders of their promised state encompass all
of their land israel occupied in including mostly arab east jerusalem
which israel later annexed in move not recognised by the international
community as their capital
resolving borders resolves settlements resolving jerusalem resolves
settlements the chief us diplomat told reporters after meeting jordanian
foreign minister nasser judeh in washington
we are working with the israelis the palestinian authority and the arab
states to take the steps needed to relaunch the negotiations as soon as possible
and without preconditions clinton said
the parties can reach solution that reconciles the palestinian goal of an
independent and viable state based on the lines with agreed swaps and the
israeli goal of jewish state with secure and recognised borders she said
president barack obama administration efforts to revive the peace talks have
so far been frustrated despite heavy pressure on israel the palestinians and
arab states to make positive gestures
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu announced in november partial
suspension of settlement activity in the west bank but not in occupied east
jerusalem as gesture ahead of the resumption of talks
the palestinians have nevertheless repeatedly insisted on full suspension of
settlement construction in all land occupied in
obama special middle east envoy george mitchell who said earlier this week
that peace talks should not last more than two years is expected to return to
the region later this month to push the latest us initiative
