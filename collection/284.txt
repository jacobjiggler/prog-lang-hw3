chavez alleges incursion by us war plane
caracas jan afp
president hugo chavez said friday us military aircraft entered venezuelan
airspace and accused the united states and the netherlands of provocative
action
chavez said he ordered two jets to intercept orion anti
submarine surveillance aircraft that entered venezuelan airspace from the nearby
netherlands antilles
the us plane returned to the dutch caribbean island of curacao after it twice
entered venezuelan airspace where it spent total of about half an hour and
was escorted out by the
we re not inventing anything when we say the government of holland must assume
their responsibilities the firebrand leftist leader said
we are here ready to defend venezuela sovereignty we accuse the
governments of the united states and holland of launching provocative actions
against venezuela to find an excuse to attack venezuela
last month chavez accused the united states of launching spy plane from
colombia that violated his country airspace and vowed to shoot down any such
aircraft in the future
ordered these little planes to be shot down chavez added on his weekly
television and radio program we cannot permit this
venezuela suspended diplomatic relations with colombia in july in response to
us colombian military base deal denouncing it as military threat to the
sovereignty of latin american countries and saying it paved the way for
possible attack against venezuela
in december chavez said the us military was using dutch islands off venezuela
caribbean coast aruba bonaire and curacao as staging area for
possible attack the netherlands has denied the claims
chavez devalues venezuela currency first time since
caracas jan afp
venezuelan president hugo chavez devalued the bolivar friday for the first time
since creating dual foreign currency system
the move will favor some sectors of the economy the government considers
priorities with the bolivar pegged at per dollar down from per
dollar
non essential imports will be subject to rate of bolivars per dollar
the leftist leader said that the health food import machinery books and
technology sectors as well as public sector imports and remittances would
benefit from the preferential rate
the higher exchange rate would apply to items such as automobiles
telecommunications tobacco beverages chemicals petrochemicals and
electronics
the largest oil producer in south america venezuela slipped into recession in
for the first time in six years due to drop in oil prices and production
it is also battling percent inflation
caracas had repeatedly ruled out devaluating its currency even as the dollar
soared for months compared to the bolivar
