no plan to send troops to yemen obama says
washington jan afp
president barack obama says he has no intention of sending us troops to fight
militants in yemen and somalia and that al qaeda activities are still centered
along the afghanistan pakistan border

areas around the globe to make sure that we re keeping the american people

countries like yemen in countries like somalia think working with
international partners is most effective at this point
have no intention of sending us boots on the ground in these regions he
added
thinly stretched us military has deployed large troop contingents to iraq and
afghanistan
the number of us troops in afghanistan where obama has vowed to recenter the
us war against al qaeda militants who have also sought refuge in neighboring
pakistan is set to triple under his watch from levels reaching some
later this year
washington has urged yemen to crack down on al qaeda after the local franchise
of osama bin laden network said it was behind narrowly avoided christmas day
bombing aboard us bound airliner
but the impoverished arabian peninsula country already faces litany of
challenges including water shortage dwindling oil reserves shiite
rebellion in the north and movement for autonomy in the south
somalia is also the focus of us counterterrorism efforts where an embattled
transitional government faces relentless attacks from extremist shebab militants

the same is true in somalia another country where there are large chunks that
are not fully under government control and al qaeda is trying to take advantage
of them
he insisted that the border region between afghanistan and pakistan remains the
epicenter of al qaeda their leadership and their extremist allies
us officials have said they are seeking to boost military and intelligence
cooperation with yemen
yemen does not want to have american ground troops there and that good
response for us to hear certainly said general david petraeus the head of us
central command which oversees region encompassing the middle east the gulf
the horn of africa and central asia
of course we would always want host nation to deal with problem itself we
want to help we re providing assistance he told cnn in an interview aired
sunday
petraeus said washington planned to more than double its economic aid to yemen
this year to million dollars or more
although that amount pales in comparison to the billions of dollars washington
has poured into afghanistan the general stressed other allies were providing
aid including saudi arabia which has reportedly allocated two billion dollars
and the united arab emirates which pledged million dollars to sanaa

uae berlin urge iran to abandon uncooperative nuclear stand
abu dhabi jan afp
the united arab emirates and germany said on sunday that iran must do more to
allay the international community concerns about its nuclear programme or
fresh sanctions would be likely
following meeting in abu dhabi uae foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed
al nahayan said he hoped iran would cooperate with the un nuclear watchdog
we are very concerned about iran non transparent behaviour with regard to its
nuclear programme he said after talks with his visiting german counterpart
guido westerwelle
that is based on its lack of cooperation with the iaea international atomic
energy agency we want more active cooperation from iran that would be in the
interests of the world the region and iran itself
sheikh abdullah noted that the un security council could soon pass fourth
round of sanctions to try to force iran to abandon sensitive nuclear work which
the west fears is cover for an atomic weapons programme
tehran denies wanting to acquire nuclear bomb
we hope that iran will behave so cooperatively that sanctions will not be
necessary the uae foreign minister said
we in the united arab emirates as neighbour state are particularly affected
by what iran is targeted by but also everything it does
he added that his country could serve as an example for the transparent use of
nuclear energy pointing to billion dollar deal with south korea to build
four nuclear power plants in the united arab emirates
westerwelle who is on tour of gulf states and whose country is one of six
working to convince tehran to cooperate with the iaea said he and abdullah were
in broad agreement
the ministers also discussed the security of yemen amid reports that westerwelle
planned to visit the strife ridden country on monday and negotiations to end
continuing hostage crisis there
westerwelle declined to comment directly on either issue
the hostage taking is of course barbaric act that we condemn he said
referring to german family of five and briton who were abducted in yemen
last june
we are doing everything we can to allow the hostages to return to their loved
ones he said but declined to discuss specifics
on yemen westerwelle said would not like to talk about travel plans at this
time for various reasons
delegation sources also said they would not confirm the reports
long standing concerns that yemen has become haven for islamic militants were
thrown into sharp focus when nigerian man allegedly trained in yemen was
charged with trying to blow up us bound jet on december
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula claimed the botched attack and has called for
attacks on western interests in yemen
germany is by far the largest european contributor of development aid to yemen
with some million euros million dollars earmarked for the impoverished
country for
during talks earlier on sunday in doha with his qatari counterpart sheikh hamad
bin jassem bin jabr al thani and the emir sheikh hamad bin khalifa al thani
westerwelle also discussed yemen
sources said the emir and westerwelle agreed that lasting solution to the
internal conflicts on its borders with shiite rebellion in the north and the
rise of secessionist movement in the south could only come through dialogue

cup of nations kicked off in angola
president jose eduardo dos santos denounced friday attack by separatist rebels
in the northern enclave of cabinda where the teammates were flying back to togo
with their two slain colleagues
we condemn this act of terror but the competition will continue in cabinda
dos santos said as he opened the tournament we are together may the best man
win
his government and african football officials pleaded to the last second for
togolese authorities to allow the players to fulfill their wish to compete in
the tournament to honour their slain colleagues
it very sad it hard for africa and for us these things are part of life
you have to accept it togo captain emmanuel adebayor told afp at the airport
in cabinda the team plane left for home later sunday evening
cabinda is to host seven of the tournament matches but with togo
goalkeeper kodjovi obilale still in critical care at south african hospital
their prime minister ordered the team home
we understand the position of the players who want to in some way avenge their
dead colleagues but it would be irresponsible for the togolese authorities to
allow them to continue houngbo told reporters in lome
rebels ambushed the togo convoy as they drove into the cabinda enclave from
neighbouring congo brazzaville on friday leaving players cowering under their
seats during minute gunbattle with security forces
goalkeeper obilale was airlifted to johannesburg hospital to undergo surgery
to treat gunshot wounds to the lower back and abdomen
he is ventilated at the moment it still early stages at the moment
hospital spokeswoman said he is in critical condition but he stable
separatist rebels threatened to carry out more attacks saying they had warned
confederation of african football caf boss issa hayatou against holding
matches in cabinda
this is going to continue because the nation is at war because hayatou
persists said rodrigues mingas secretary general of the forces for the
liberation of the state of cabinda military position flec pm
we wrote two months before the nations cup to mr issa hayatou to warn him that
we were at war he did not want to take our warnings into consideration mingas
told afp by telephone
they were warned they knew it and they closed their eyes
mingas faction is one of several groups battling for independence in small but
oil rich cabinda cornerstone of angola economic boom despite peace
agreement
mingas now lives in exile in france and french foreign ministry spokesman on
sunday vowed response to his comments
south african president jacob zuma condemned the shooting as shocking and
unacceptable but brushed away speculation that the attack could affect his
nation hosting of the world cup in june
he reiterated that south africa remains percent ready to host the fifa
world cup and dismissed speculation that the angolan incident had any bearing
on the world cup tournament in south africa his office said in statement
despite the sombre mood in cabinda spirits soared in luanda where cars honked
and pedestrians blew trumpets to celebrate angola opening match against mali
however mali was able to wipe out four goal deficit to draw with the
hosts
the tournament was meant as coming out party for the oil rich nation after
decades of civil war and angola put on splashy opening ceremony with
fireworks laser lights and traditional dancers enacting scenes from the
country history
the normally traffic clogged streets were deserted as angolans gathered on
rooftops and huddled around televisions to watch the game
football mali make miracle recovery to draw with angola
luanda jan afp
mali made miraculous recovery to pull back from four goal deficit to hold
angola to draw in the opening game of the africa cup of nations here
on sunday
the hosts appeared set for the best possible start when first half double from
flavio armado and penalties from gilberto and manucho had them celebrating
famous victory
with only minutes on the clock mali looked down and out
but double from seydou keita and contributions from frederic kanoute and
mustapha yattabare gave them an improbable draw
this nations cup curtain raiser began with minute silence in memory of the
victims of friday deadly gun attack on the togo team coach in cabinda
the silence immaculately observed by the capacity crowd turned to
something much louder seconds after kick off when mali goalkeeper mahamadou
sidibe had to look lively to deal with flavio shot from the left
the angolan striker only made coach manuel jose starting xi after shrugging
off injury but keita was on the bench after missing the eagles warm up games
with thigh problem
angola were forced into an unscheduled change of personnel in the nd minute
when aderito carvalho was stretchered off and replaced by djalma campos
mali coach stephen keshi sent barcelona midfielder keita into the fray sooner
than expected when le mans forward modibo maiga limped out of contention
this was the first ever match at the november stadium built by the chinese
and ressembling smaller version of beijing birds nest
and the chicks nest burst into life in the th minute when flavio raced on to
gilberto angled metre freekick from the left to put the hosts in front
with low powerful header
one minute from the break flavio got his double another fine header set up by
fullback jose malbina alberto
that prompted the wife of angolan head of state jose eduardo dos santos to jump
off her seat and execute very unpresidential style jig
mali multi million pound strikeforce led by sevilla kanoute had proved
strangely impotent in the first half
they looked more purposeful force after the interval with only angola keeper
carlos fernandes charge out of his box stopping mali captain mahamadou diarra
shot
gilberto then struck from the spot after he was brought down in the box by
mamadou samassa
the al ahly midfielder proved cool customer as he converted but was then
invited to have second go by egyptian referee essam abdel fatah which he duly
struck past sidibe
manucho got angola fourth also from the spot after another foul on gilberto
but then angola crumbled
keita began the comeback after scramble for the ball in the box following
mistake by fernandes
then kanoute struck with classy header with keita producing volley for his
double and yattabare grabbing highly unlikely point for the eagles
