weekly magazine cited an unnamed former cia agent as saying we were planning
stuff that was totally illegal
the plan went so far that other parts of the central intelligence agency were in
the loop but in the end it was scrapped because of objections by the agency
german section spiegel cited its source as saying
we said no because we were of the opinion that you just couldn do thing
like that in friendly country where there were so many us soldiers based the
source is cited as saying
the claim follows vanity fair magazine report that the us spy agency intended
to find fix and finish an al qaeda suspect in hamburg where several of those
involved in the september attacks on the united states formed an
islamist cell
vanity fair said that the cia team was sent to assassinate mamun darkanzali
syrian born german believed at the time to have known at least three of the
hijackers but in the end washington pulled the plug
darkanzali was detained by german authorities in but prosecutors dropped
their investigation in saying that although he had served as contact for
several al qaeda members he could not be considered member
spiegel however cited its source as denying there was any such plan saying
that would have been completely impossible in country like germany
the extraordinary rendition programme was set up by the administration of then
president george bush after the attacks that killed nearly people it
involved the transfer of war on terror suspects by the cia to countries known
to practise torture

forged links to militant groups after their release
spokesman geoff morrell told reporters last week that the precise number
remained classified but was in keeping with an april defense department report
in april that found that about percent of former guantanamo inmates had

their fixtures starting with group opener on monday against ghana

the team home immediately as goalkeeper kodjovi obilale recovered from gunshot
wounds in south african hospital
we understand the position of the players who want to in some way avenge their
dead colleagues but it would be irresponsible for the togolese authorities to
allow them to continue houngbo told reporters in lome
if there is team or persons present under the banner of togo at the opening
of the africa cup of nations this afternoon it will be false representation
the team must return today
captain emmanuel adebayor told french radio station that togo president faure

british pm inspired by mandela in political fight back
london jan afp
british prime minister gordon brown sunday dismissed failed political plot
against him as silliness and revealed he is turning to nelson mandela for
inspiration ahead of the general election
although call last week by two former ministers for vote on brown
leadership fizzled out there was fresh reminder of the labour premier
weakness sunday when former senior party figure called on him to quit
fighting back after bruising week brown gave an interview to the news of the
world britain biggest selling tabloid insisting he was not going to spend
his time dealing with things that in my view have been form of silliness
he also vowed to serve full term if he wins the election which must be held
by june
brown disclosed that he was inspired over the christmas break by the film
invictus which tells the story of then south african president mandela and
the country rugby union team at the world cup in the years right after
the end of apartheid and white minority rule
the nelson mandela film you will be interested to know is about
determination and that is what am all about brown said
he also has been reading the poem by william ernest henley which gave the film
its name and contains the lines under the bludgeonings of fate my head is
bloody but unbowed
invictus is very interesting because it poem mandela gave to the south
african rugby captain francois pienaar and says this is poem that influenced
me when was in prison and it should influence you brown said the poem
certainly made an impact on me
brown added the he has been talking to his predecessor tony blair who he
described as one of the greatest british prime ministers
tony and talk lot brown said we have kept in touch and ll be drawing
on his advice as always do
blair is expected to give evidence to britain public inquiry on the iraq war
within few weeks amid reports some labour figures are worried his testimony
could prove embarrassing to the party ahead of the election
meanwhile the fall out from last week failed leadership coup continued as
peter watt former labour general secretary who resigned in urged brown
to stand aside for the sake of labour
gordon is big political figure but he lacks the emotional intelligence
required by modern leader watt told the mail on sunday which is also
publishing extracts from his memoirs
in them watt describes downing street under brown as shambles completely
dysfunctional and said of his premiership gordon was simply making it up as
he went along
despite some plotting against brown leadership support for his labour party
has increased slightly in the last month according to the latest icm opinion
poll for the sunday telegraph
it gave david cameron main opposition conservatives an unchanged percent
support compared to percent for labour up one percent icm interviewed
adults by telephone on wednesday and thursday
the poll also found that percent of voters thought labour would do better
without brown as leader compared to percent who thought the party would do
worse
cameron told the bbc sunday that britain needs an election soon both parties
have already effectively been campaigning since the start of the new year
if anything the last week demonstrates that we need to have strong determined
leadership from united government cameron said
we can get that from labour and gordon brown and an increasing number of
people in the labour party seem to be saying that

football napoli give warning of champions league intentions
rome jan afp
napoli went games unbeaten under coach walter mazzarri following home
victory against sampdoria on sunday that boosted their growing challenge for
top four finish
german denis second half goal earned the southerners three points that leaves
them fourth in the serie table just goal difference behind juventus and
point above as roma
they have not been beaten since october league games and one cup match
when former samp boss mazzarri took over from the sacked former italy coach
roberto donadoni
it was just deserts from game napoli largely bossed against free falling samp
the early season pace setters now in the bottom half
cristian maggio had the best chance of the opening period when played in one on
one with luca castellazzi from walter gargano through ball but the midfielder
shot straight at the goalkeeper body
denis who had replaced the injured ezequiel lavezzi in the first half had
goal harshly ruled out three minutes into the second period for dubious
looking offside decision
maggio had two more opportunities but fired wide with the first and was denied
by substitute goalkeeper vincenzo fiorillo with the second
but minutes from time denis beat fiorillo to lofted cross from hugo
campagnaro to head home the winner
french goalkeeper sebastien frey made two crucial second half stops to help
fiorentina beat bari in florence and go sixth
romania captain adrian mutu had cancelled out paulo barreto opener in the
first period
frey made great saves from sergio almiron and sergio alvarez before riccardo
meggiorini beat the frenchman but not the woodwork
after almiron was dismissed substitute jose castillo grabbed the winner his
first goal for fiorentina before he too saw red
palermo are level on points with fiorentina after uruguayan forward edison
cavani penalty gave them win over coach less atalanta
sunday main action was due to take place in the evening as third placed juve
host second placed ac milan
both teams will be trying to reel in runaway leaders inter milan whose stunning
late come from behind victory over siena at the san siro on saturday gave
them an point lead in the scudetto race

tripoli jan afp
the appeal trial of swiss businessman rashid hamdani sentenced to months in
jail for overstaying his libyan visa was adjourned on sunday for two weeks his
lawyer said
the trial has been postponed until january salah zahaf told afp without
giving reason for the latest delay
hamdani and another swiss businessman max goeldi who have been holed up at
their country embassy in tripoli were initially due in court in december but
legal proceedings were delayed at the request of the defence
on november both were sentenced to month jail terms in absentia for
overstaying their libyan visas goeldi is due to launch his own appeal on
thursday
the pair are also accused of illegal business activities having been caught up
in diplomatic row between switzerland and libya over the swiss authorities
treatment of leader moamer kadhafi son hannibal
at the start of january those trials were postponed until saturday for goeldi
and until sunday for hamdani
french lawyer emmanuel altit is to join the defence team an associate said
on sunday confirming reports in swiss newspapers
the lawyer from paris defended group of bulgarian nurses who were detained in
libya for eight years over an aids scandal before being released in
goeldi senior manager at the swedish swiss engineering giant abb and
hamdani who works for small construction firm were detained after hannibal
kadhafi and his wife were briefly arrested in geneva in when two hotel
servants complained he had mistreated them

allowed to leave libya since july
israel says no us financial pressure over peace talks
jerusalem jan afp
israel on sunday dismissed an implicit threat by top us official to apply
financial pressure on the jewish state in order to advance peace talks
president barack obama middle east envoy george mitchell said in an interview
with pbs television earlier in the week that under us law washington can
withhold support on loan guarantees to israel
but israeli finance minister yuval steinitz said on sunday that we have no
indication that there is any intention to pressure us through the guarantees
only few months ago we reached an agreement with the us treasury and state
departments on the extension of their guarantees
the united states offered israel billion dollars in loan guarantees in the
early to assist it in absorbing hundreds of thousands of immigrants from
the former soviet union
in former us president george bush temporarily suspended the approval of
the guarantees by congress in order to pressure israel to join an international
peace conference
but us senator joseph lieberman said congress would scrap any such plan
any attempt to pressure israel to force israel to the negotiating table by
denying israel support will not pass in congress he told reporters in
jerusalem after meeting israeli and palestinian leaders
congress will act against any attempt to do that don think it will come to
this point lieberman who was flanked by three other senators added
loan guarantees are not cash grants but allow israel to take loans from
international bodies under better conditions and lower interest rates
prime minister benjamin netanyahu office said in response to mitchell
comments that everyone knows that the palestinian authority is refusing to
renew the peace talks while israel has taken important and significant steps to
kick start the process
the palestinian authority needs to change its ways not israel his office
said in statement
despite intensive diplomatic efforts washington has so far failed to revive the
stalled middle east peace process key component in the obama administration
foreign policy
the palestinians have said they will not restart talks until israel freezes all
settlement activity while israel has enacted only partial easing of
construction in the occupied territories
china saudi fail to resolve petrochemicals dispute
riyadh jan afp
senior officials from saudi arabia and china on sunday failed to resolve chinese
dumping charges on certain saudi petrochemicals although they played down the
impact of the dispute
finance minister ibrahim al assaf said talks with visiting chinese commerce
minister chen deming went well but the two sides could not resolve the issue of
china anti dumping penalties on imports of butanediol from saudi arabia
we continued to discuss this today we believe we can resolve this problem
assaf said in press conference with chen
on december china announced anti dumping tariffs of up to percent on
saudi and taiwan produced butanediol chemical used to make some
plastics elastic fibre and polyurethanes
the decision followed investigation which showed that the exporters were dumping
it at too low prices and hurting chinese producers
after the penalty was announced the saudi international petrochemical co said
that china had levied percent anti dumping tax on imports of its
butanediol
chen and assaf meanwhile said they have targeted percent growth in
bilateral trade between and increasing the total annual value from
billion dollars last year to billion dollars
bilateral trade is heavily weighted in saudi arabia favour with china
importing mainly crude oil and petrochemical products
