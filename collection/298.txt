myself by taking four strokes to reach the green at the last and completing my
round with bogey said schwartzel
said to my caddie wynand after hitting my second shot short and right we are
still two ahead so let us make five and let them make birdie and it worked
in my favour

injured in the explosion and was in serious but stable condition officials
said
the foreign office said it thought that year old hamer the paper defence
correspondent was the first british journalist to die in afghanistan
my heartfelt thoughts and sympathies are with the families friends and
colleagues of rupert and philip prime minister gordon brown said in

their courage skill and dedication to reporting from the frontline was
incredibly important and ensured that the world could see and read about our
heroic troops

soldiers when roadside bomb exploded beneath their armoured vehicle

figure wonderful friend who was hugely popular with his colleagues

word said about him
defence secretary bob ainsworth said there had been great respect for hamer in
the ministry of defence
the sacrifice of service personnel is well documented and rightly respected
