palestinian student forcibly sent to gaza gets degree
gaza city jan afp
palestinian student forcibly relocated from the west bank to gaza two months
before she was to complete her university studies was awarded her degree in the
hamas ruled territory on sunday
berlanty azzam who on october was detained and sent to gaza by israel
because she had gaza id said she had challenged the occupation by
completing her studies at the vatican sponsored bethlehem university
am sad because was not able to graduate with my colleagues in bethlehem
but was able to challenge the occupation and today am graduating from the
university despite all the difficulties she said at ceremony attended by
family and friends her eyes filled with tears of joy
peter bray the vice chancellor of bethlehem university praised azzam
determination as he awarded the bachelor degree in gaza city saying the
school was not going to let the israeli military prevent her from graduating
he added that her professors had worked with her via the telephone and internet
to allow her to complete her studies from gaza
azzam was handcuffed and blindfolded when she was sent to gaza in october
according to the israeli human rights group gisha which unsuccessfully
petitioned israel supreme court to allow her to return
the court upheld the state decision that azzam may not return to the west bank
because she had lived there since without the necessary israeli permit
the state admitted that azzam had received permit to travel to the west bank
via israel in but argued that she should have obtained further
authorisation to remain there even though it admitted none existed at the time
according to gisha
israel controls the palestinian population registry and since has not
permitted address changes from the gaza strip to the west bank
like azzam an estimated palestinians could be forcibly sent to gaza
because their addresses are registered there according to gisha
israel has severely restricted the travel of palestinians into and out of gaza
since the islamist hamas movement seized power in june and egypt only
occasionally opens its rafah border crossing with the territory

football accies within ace of rangers cup upset
glasgow jan afp
scottish cup holders rangers survived shock fourth round exit away to hamilton
academicals after thrilling draw at new douglas park on sunday
rangers the scottish premier league leaders were cruising at up in the
th minute after goals from steven whittaker and kenny miller
but hamilton hit back with three goals in minutes towards the end of the
first half simon mensing starting the fightback from the penalty spot before
marco paixao and mickael antoine curier stunned the visitors
however miller penalty just after the hour mark brought the score back to
and ensured replay at ibrox after hamilton played out the final minutes
man down after richie hastings was sent off
there was no hint of the shock scoreline to come when rangers points ahead
of top flight rivals hamilton went ahead in the fourth minute
hamilton failed to clear steven davis free kick and the ball fell to whittaker
who shot high onto the net
hamilton wasted couple of chances and were punished for their inaccuracy when
miller doubled rangers lead
steven davis ball into the box was helped on by kris boyd and fellow striker
miller shot low past accies goalkeeper tomas cerny
but the match turned when referee charles richmond awarded the home side
penalty after ruling kirk broadfoot had fouled mark mclaughlin in the box as the
players went up for header
mensing made no mistake from the spot and worse was to follow for rangers as
hamilton scored twice in first half stoppage time
rangers goalkeeper allan mcgregor could not deal with james mcarthur free kick
and paixao scored on the rebound after antoine curier initial shot was
blocked
rangers who already lost davis to injury then saw boyd limp off and their
problems were compounded when mensing played in antoine curier who beat the
stranded mcgregor with composed finish
however rangers were back on level terms in the rd minute after richmond gave
the visitors penalty which infuriated the hosts just as much as his first half
spot kick award had angered the gers
stuart elliott was lying on the ground in the area when the ball hit his arm and
that was enough for richmond to deem his action deliberate handball
miller then kept his cool to send cerny the wrong way from the spot
hamilton suffered another blow when in the th minute hastings was sent off
for second bookable offence

dubai jan afp
an emirati court on sunday acquitted sheikh issa bin zayed the brother of the
united arab emirates president of charges of torturing an afghan citizen his
lawyer told afp
the court acquitted sheikh issa after establishing he was not responsible for
the torture lawyer habib al mulla said
the court accepted our defence that the sheikh was under the influence of drugs
medicine that left him unaware of his actions the lawyer said
the court in the oasis city of al ain however ordered two co defendants to pay
temporary compensation of dirhams dollars to the afghan who
can file new lawsuit to claim full compensation the lawyer added
the two us defendants of lebanese origin brothers ghassan and bassam nabulsi
were sentenced to five years in jail each in absentia for their role in the

the court also sentenced three others employed at the farm where the torture
took place in to between one and three years in jail likewise in absentia
according to mulla guard at the farm was acquitted

new workers tombs found near egypt great pyramid
cairo jan afp
egyptian archaeologists have unearthed number of tombs of workers who helped
to construct the country largest pyramid culture minister faruk hosni said in
statement on sunday
antiquities chief zahi hawass led the team that uncovered new group of tombs
dating back to the period of the fourth dynasty bc which belonged
to workers who helped to build the great pyramid hosni said
the first of these tombs was discovered in
hawass said the new discovery at the cheops pyramid was particularly important
as it belies all that was said about the construction of the pyramids by bound
workers and contradicts the idea that they were constructed by slaves
he cited as evidence the fact that the tombs are located in the direct vicinity
of the pyramid and even overlook it if they were slaves they would not have
been able to build their tombs in this area
hawass also mentioned evidence indicating that the wealthy families of upper
egypt and the nile delta provided the workers with calves and sheep daily
in return for tax exemption
he believes the number of workers who built the cheops pyramid did not exceed

frontrunner ivo josipovic vowing to crack down on corruption and lead the
recession hit nation into the european union
josipovic social democrat is up against zagreb mayor milan bandic in the

civilized and decent country
he is an educated man and he is clear of corruption she told afp
josipovic lecturer in criminal law and classical music composer who has
enjoyed an untarnished political career has vowed uncompromising fight against
corruption
overcoming corruption is key challenge if croatia which joined nato last
year wants to succeed in its bid to join the european union by and put
the trauma of the balkan wars of the further behind it
corruption is also major domestic issue with several investigations underway

the economy out of recession
croatia where unemployment is running at around percent is forecasting
contraction of up to percent in its economy for its external debt is
meanwhile nearly percent of gross domestic product
the most important is to work in improving economic situation and ending the
crisis parliamentary speaker luka bebic as he cast his ballot
despite their pledges on the campaign trail the day to day running of croatia
is largely the preserve of conservative government led by prime minister
