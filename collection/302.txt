most iraq families of blackwater victims accept settlement
baghdad jan afp
all but one of the families of iraqis killed in shooting by us
security guards have accepted compensation from the blackwater firm lawyer
wounded in the attack said on sunday
confirmation of the payouts comes less than two weeks after us federal judge
dismissed charges against five guards of the american private security firm
accused of killing the civilians in an unprovoked attack
all of the families of the dead agreed except for one family said year
old lawyer hassan jabbar salman who himself was injured in an arm the chest
and legs in the attack
he said the family of each person killed in the nisur square shooting in central
baghdad was offered dollars while those wounded received between
and dollars
salman declined to specify how much he was to receive in compensation which has
yet to be deposited in his bank account
investigators said shortly after the september shooting that salman
car alone was hit with bullets
agreed to drop the civil complaint but the criminal complaint us
prosecutors are still handling it and they have invited me to attend the
trial he told afp referring to possible appeal
salman said blackwater lawyer met in late november with victims families in
istanbul where the settlement was reached
blackwater which has since been renamed xe took the families signatures and
fingerprints and later also recorded video statements of them accepting the
settlement terms he said
since then however nine of the families have petitioned the office of khaled
al attiya parliament deputy speaker for the deals to be nullified saying
they were forced to accept the deal under pressure
we were afraid we signed the documents under duress said year old mehdi
abdul khaddhar day labourer who lost one of his eyes in the shooting we
were pressured
the sole family member who has not accepted settlement haitham al rubaie
said he had turned down blackwater repeated offers
demand to prosecute them in criminal court for the disaster they carried
out said the medical doctor who lost his wife and son in the shooting
ve had enough of them underestimating the value of iraqi blood
salman said that rubaie had demanded million dollars in compensation while
the doctor confirmed he wanted financial compensation but declined to specify
figure
on december us federal judge ricardo urbina dismissed charges against five
guards part of convoy of armoured vehicles who stood accused of killing the
iraqi civilians in september using guns and grenades
while iraq says people were killed the guards were charged with deaths
urbina said in his ruling that prosecutors violated the guards rights by using
incriminating statements they had made under immunity during us state
department probe
the us government said on friday it will review the decision
we respect the independence of the judiciary the decision of the judge does
not exonerate the defendants or necessarily terminate the proceedings state
department spokesman pj crowley told reporters
the verdict has provoked furor in iraq with the government saying it was
looking at how best to respond but was limited by the us judicial system and
bilateral agreement between baghdad and washington
salman was sharply critical of both the us legal system and the iraqi
government
the american judicial system is not honest how could they drop charges from
people who killed in cold blood he asked
where has the iraqi government been since not one official has asked
about us they have not helped us the us embassy were better than the
government said the lawyer
the case was among the most sensational seeking to hold blackwater employees
accountable for what was seen as culture of lawlessness and lack of
accountability in the company iraq operations
blackwater pulled out of iraq in may after the state department refused to renew
its contracts

iran nuclear facilities can be bombed us commander
washington jan afp
top us military commander responsible for the middle east and the gulf region
said the united states has developed contingency plans to deal with iran
nuclear facilities insisting that they can be bombed
well they certainly can be bombed general david petraeus head of us central
command told cnn television as he commented on suggestions that iranian nuclear
facilities were heavily fortified
the level of effect would vary with who it is that carries it out what
ordnance they have and what capability they can bring to bear he added
the network plans to air the interview later sunday but has released some
excerpts
petraeus did not elaborate on the plans but he said the military has considered
the impacts of any action taken there cnn said
it would be almost literally irresponsible if centcom were not to have been
thinking about the various what ifs and to make plans for whole variety of
different contingencies petraeus said
iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes but the united
states and other western nations fear tehran wants to acquire nuclear weapons
israel has called iran nuclear program the major threat facing its nation
petraeus declined to comment about israel military capabilities according to
cnn
iran had until the end of last year to accept deal offered five permanent un
security council members britain china france russia and the united
states plus germany
it did not do so instead tehran gave the west until the end of january to
accept its own proposal
petraeus said he thought there was still time for the nations to engage iran in
diplomacy noting there is no deadline on the enactment of any us contingency
plans cnn noted
but he added that there period of time certainly before all this might
come to head if you will

angolan rebels threaten new attacks in cabinda
johannesburg jan afp
separatists who claimed deadly shooting on togo football team threatened new
attacks in angola saying sunday they had warned against hosting the africa cup
of nations in their province
the forces for the liberation of the state of cabinda military position flec
pm said attacks would continue because african football boss issa hayatou had
refused to move games scheduled in cabinda
this is going to continue because the nation is at war because hayatou
persists the group secretary general rodrigues mingas told afp by
telephone
weapons will continue to talk he said this is our home and it time
angola understood that
we wrote two months before the nations cup to mr issa hayatou to warn him that
we were at war he did not want to take our warnings into consideration said
mingas who lives in exile in france
they were warned they knew it and they closed their eyes
if they angola government wanted to hold the nations cup in cabinda it
because they had hidden marketing agenda to make people believe that there
peace in cabinda so that investors would invest in cabinda he said
mingas said dozen men were involved in friday attack that killed togo
assistant coach and squad spokesman nine others in the convoy were injured and
mingas said one guerrilla was shot in the leg
the rebels opened fire as togo team crossed the border from congo brazzaville
there was counter attack that when we really erupted with gunfire
mingas said adding the gun battle lasted about minutes
we didn specifically target the togolese it could have been angola ivory
coast ghana anything is possible he said we are at war and it no
holds barred
we always regret the death of human beings but there are also thousands of
cabindans killed over years he said
the separatist struggle broke out in when angola won independence from
portugal the province now produces percent of the oil that has powered
angola economic boom
kilometre mile wide strip of the democratic republic congo separates
cabinda from the rest of angola in colonial times the area was known as
portuguese congo and separatists argue that the territory was never part of
angola
luanda says the conflict ended with peace deal with the front for the
liberation of the enclave of cabinda flec
but mingas said his faction broke away from the main group in and is now
one of several autonomous guerrilla groups that collaborate with government in
exile
we re waiting for crackdown as always happens there are armed
security forces in cabinda mingas said flec is nationalist movement
resistance movement not terrorist movement

dozens of qaeda militants hiding out in yemen governor
sanaa jan afp
dozens of al qaeda jihadists are hiding out in remote area of yemen top
official said as president ali abdullah saleh sunday urged militants in the
conflict ridden country to lay down their arms
al qaeda fighters among them saudis and egyptians have streamed in from
afghanistan and have joined local members of the jihadist network in lairs
carved out in the rugged kour mountain in southern shabwa province said
provincial governor ali hasan al ahmadi
there are dozens of saudi and egyptian al qaeda militants who came to the
province ahmadi told the london based al sharq al awsat daily
this is in addition to yemenis who came from marib and abyan provinces and
number of militants from shabwa province itself he added
among them he added are the leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap
nasser al wahishi his number two saeed ali al shehri saudi and radical us
yemeni cleric anwar al awlaqi
the egyptians and saudis ahmadi said had travelled to yemen from afghanistan
aqap group has claimed it was behind the botched christmas day bomb attack
onboard us airliner while yemeni officials have said the would be bomber
umar farouk abdulmutallab had been in contact with awlaqi
the united states has accused the al qaeda branch in yemen of training
abdulmutallab who tried to blow up northwest airline flight before it landed
in detroit but was overpowered by passengers
it has also accused awlaqi of instigating terrorism and has said he had links
with the man suspected of shooting dead people at texas military base in
november major nidal hasan
president saleh meanwhile said he is prepared to hold talks with the jihadists
if they turn their backs on violence
if al qaeda militants lay down their arms renounce violence and terrorism
and return to wisdom we are prepared to deal with them saleh told abu dhabi
tv in an interview carried by yemen saba news agency on sunday
we are prepared to deal with anyone who renounces violence and terrorism he
said
but the president whose country is also facing shiite rebellion in the north
and movement for autonomy in the south stressed the government will crack
down heavily on those who resort to violence
they are threat not only to yemen but also to international peace and
security particularly al qaeda they are ignorants drug dealers and
illiterate they have no relation with islam he said
saudi analyst anwar eshki said al qaeda militants have been fleeing to yemen
after they came under tremendous pressure in afghanistan and pakistan in
addition to crackdown in neighbouring saudi arabia
the al qaeda network is trying to establish itself in yemen eshki head of
the jeddah based middle east strategic studies centre told afp
eshki believes al qaeda in yemen will be far more dangerous than in afghanistan
because of its proximity to gulf oil resources and transportation lines
the oil rich gulf region provides just under one fifth of the world crude oil
supplies
saleh said security forces and air force have achieved impressive victories
against al qaeda in the provinces of abyan shabwa and the capital sanaa
yemeni security forces insist they are winning the war against the jihadists
pointing to two separate air raids in december that killed more than
suspected al qaeda members
on wednesday yemeni officials announced the capture of key qaeda leader
mohammed al hanq and two other militants believed behind threats against western
interests in sanaa that caused embassies to close for several days
yemen insists it can win the war against the militants without us military
intervention but analysts fear osama bin laden ancestral homeland cannot
tackle the jihadists on its own
britain and the united states have already announced plans to fund counter
extremism police in yemen and washington is sharply increasing military and
economic aid to the impoverished nation officials have said

australia welcomes indian call for restraint over attacks
sydney jan afp
australia government on sunday welcomed call from india for restraint in
media coverage of attacks on indians stressing there was no evidence that race
was factor in two recent incidents
new delhi urged its media to act responsibly after an indian man was burned in
an incident in melbourne on saturday week after year old nitin garg was
stabbed to death in the city western suburbs
the attacks followed spate of violence against indians in victoria state last
year and have prompted strong reaction in the indian press with one newspaper
likening australian police to the racist ku klux klan
australia acting foreign minister simon crean welcomed the statement from
foreign ministry spokesman vishnu prakash who advised the indian media to
exercise utmost restraint in reporting on these sensitive issues
am very pleased that overnight the government has issued what believe is
very constructive and responsible advice and that is not to overreact to it to
understand that investigations are being undertaken crean said
we need to get all of the facts first and we shouldn overreact until all of
the facts are in
in new delhi australian high commissioner peter varghese conceded sunday the
attacks had soured bilateral ties and criticised the local media for blaming the
incidents on alleged apathy of the australian authorities
our image in india has taken beating he told the cnn ibn television
station citing negative media coverage
varghese also complained that sections of the indian press gave the impression
that there are marauding gangs of australians who do nothing else but target
indians all day
