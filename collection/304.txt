jal won forge capital tie up with us carrier report
tokyo jan afp
troubled japan airlines jal is unlikely to form capital tie up with us
carrier and will limit the partnership to business tie up for now an economic
daily reported sunday
jal has been offered financial help by both american airlines and delta air
lines which are competing to take stake in the company and increase their
respective shares of the lucrative asian market
debt ridden jal has studied capital tie up with one or other of the airlines
as it would limit the amount of taxpayer money needed for an out of court
rehabilitation
but the japanese airline is now expected to file for bankruptcy with guarantee
of public support next week under rescue plan mapped out by the state backed
enterprise turnaround initiative corp etic japanese media reported
the etic which is overseeing jal restructuring believes capital tie up
with us carrier would complicate the government led rehabilitation process and
narrow the options of the soon to be selected new management the nikkei said
citing unnamed sources
the etic originally planned to pick foreign partner by the end of this month
but is now expected to make final decision no earlier than february the
nikkei said
since autumn both delta and american have held talks with jal in hopes of
securing capital and business alliance and have shown willingness to inject
around billion yen billion dollars worth of loans and investments
media reports have suggested jal was leaning towards capital tie up with delta
and joining the skyteam alliance leaving the oneworld group which includes
american airlines
american airlines reported last week it had increased its investment offer by
million dollars to billion dollars
in the meantime media reports say the government and the etic have asked kazuo
inamori founder of precision equipment maker kyocera and number two telecom
operator kddi to become jal new chief executive
inamori who is and now honorary chairman of kyocera is expected to respond
this week the nikkei and jiji press said
jal current president haruka nishimatsu and most other board members are to
step down when the etic finalises the rescue plan
