football we must defeat malawi says algeria playmaker ziani
luanda jan afp
playmaker karim ziani says algeria must defeat malawi monday in the opening
group match for both teams if they hope to reach the african nations cup
knockout phase
hosts angola and mali complete the mini league and media expectations suggest
tight three way fight for two quarter finals places with malawi considered
outsiders
veteran germany based ziani has been key figure in an algerian revival that
culminated in qualification for the world cup at the expense of fierce
rivals egypt after play off
the desert foxes are also back at the nations cup after two tournament
absence and the midfielder says he has never played in stronger algerian
national team
so much depends on our first cup match against malawi victory is all that
counts and we owe to ourselves and our nation to succeed stressed ziana to
reporters
there is lot more quality and mental strength in the squad now than when
started representing my country because many of our squad are playing regularly
for first division clubs in europe
when first played for my country the majority of the squad were either
reserves with first division sides or starting with second division clubs he
recalled
while algeria shared with brazil the prize for best fifa rankings mover
ziana says they cannot yet be compared with fellow world cup qualifiers and
nations cup contenders cameroon ghana ivory coast and nigeria
those teams are still at higher level than us there is lots of work for us
to do but with dedication you never know this team is the strongest have
played in while wearing the green jersey
rabah saadane also coach of the foxes when they last qualified for the world
cup years ago says the draw for the day tournament has offered his squad
realistic chance of making the last eight at least
it is good draw compared with those of ivory coast and cameroon which are
very difficult think we have an excellent chance of reaching the quarter
finals
malawi whipped by algeria during their only previous nations cup appearance
in ivory coast years ago have produced warm up results which defy the
whipping boys tag
the flames triumped in mozambique snatched late away to nations cup
holders egypt and drew with ghana in swaziland to offer hope they can
deliver more this time than the one point garnered from the campaign
but it would be shock if country almost half of whose squad plays for south
african second tier league clubs dodges defeat at the new seat november

football subdued start for tragedy hit african nations cup
luanda jan afp
the african nations cup prepared for subdued start sunday with the opening
game between angola and mali overshadowed by deadly separatist attack on the
togolese team
at least two people were killed and nine injured in friday ambush in the
northern cabinda enclave darkening the spirit of what was intended to be
feast of african football ahead of this year world cup in south africa
angola finding its feet again seven years after devastating civil war that
killed at least half million people had hoped the arrival of world class
stars like didier drogba michael essien and togo emmanuel adebayor would open
new chapter in history
instead the headlines are likely to remain focused on friday minute hail of
bullets kilometres six miles from the congo brazzaville border no matter
how compelling the football over the next three weeks
the forces for the liberation of the state of cabinda military position flec
pm claimed the ambush and said attacks would continue because african football
boss issa hayatou had refused to move games scheduled in cabinda
this is going to continue because the nation is at war because hayatou
persists the group secretary general rodrigues mingas told afp by
telephone from france where he is in exile
togo government ordered the team to withdraw from the competition to allow
for grieving
but players said they would stay on even as goalkeeper kodjovi obilale lay in
johannesburg hospital recovering from surgery to bullet wounds to his lower back
and abdomen
questions were inevitably asked about the wisdom of the event organisers the
confederation of african football caf in placing matches in known
separatist hotspot
we are all little shocked and we re asking why caf were holding games in
cabinda how can you organise tournament in state of war togo
international thomas dossevi told afp
while the attack dominated news bulletins across the globe angolan state media
took hours to even mention it with friday main tv news broadcast leading with
an angolan team training session
the wall of silence was broken later when an angolan government minister
condemned the rebels in prepared statement
nations cup organisers insisted the show would go on our great concern is for
the players but the championship goes ahead caf spokesman souleymane habuba
said late friday
on saturday angola prime minister paulo kassoma called the attack an isolated
act and guaranteed teams security
some commentators raised questions about what the killing in cabinda meant for
the first world cup on the continent thousands of miles away in south africa in
five months time
but world cup chief danny jordaan gave the short shrift to the notion of
any link likening the situation to the bombing in london the day after the city
was awarded the olympics
it nothing to do with it and think everybody understands it has nothing to
do with south africa he said
when there was bomb in london no one said we should not have in london
so we cannot have double standards
hosts angola will open the tournament at gmt sunday by lining up against
mali at luanda chinese constructed november stadium named to commemorate
the day angola achieved independence in
the competition may be going ahead but no one will forget the bloody build up

china orders steps aimed at property market stability
beijing jan afp
china ordered vigilance against foreign hot money flows and speculative real
estate investment on sunday in its latest expression of concern over surging
property market
the order issued by the state council or cabinet called on authorities
nationwide to take range of measures to promote the stable and healthy
development of the real estate market
property prices have soared recently bolstered by easy bank loans tax breaks
and lower down payments introduced by the government last year to support the
real estate sector amid an economic slowdown
the price gains have raised fears of property bubble
relevant departments need to strengthen inspection and control of credit and
capital flows cross border investment and financing activities to prevent
foreign inflows of hot money from impacting china property market the
statement said
it also called for authorities to prioritise the construction of low income
housing and more closely scrutinise mortgage financing and the market in
general
however the notice did not otherwise announce the implementation of any
specific new government policies largely echoing earlier calls for stability in
the market
concerns have risen in recent months that property bubble was building due to
speculative investment amid rumours that large portion of the government
billion dollar stimulus package had been channelled into asset markets
the package was first announced in late in response to help ward off the
effects of the global economic downturn

canadian sentenced to death in saudi gets reprieve
riyadh jan afp
the case of canadian man sentenced to death for murder in saudi arabia could
be settled by blood money after the kingdom supreme court granted him
reprieve and case review his father said sunday
ali kohail the father of mohammed kohail sentenced to be executed for murder
after schoolyard brawl said he was very happy after the country
supreme court decided to send the case back to lower court for review
so happy from yesterday until now haven slept he told afp by
telephone
while the next step in the case was not clear he said it was still possible it
could be resolved by traditional diyah or blood money payment to the family
of the dead man munzer haraki
until now we have been sending people to them to discuss diyah kohail said
adding that settlement is still possible
mohammed kohail canadian citizen of palestinian origin was arrested in
january and sentenced to death for the killing of haraki year old
syrian during schoolyard brawl in jeddah
his brother sultan now was sentenced to one year in jail and lashes in
the same case because he was minor at the time of the incident
the family the canadian government and canadian rights groups had strongly
lobbied the saudis not to execute mohammed and ottawa welcomed saturday
decision
canada is very pleased to confirm that the death sentence against mohammed
kohail has been revoked and that retrial has been ordered foreign minister
lawrence cannon said in statement
the government of canada has repeatedly raised the cases of sultan and mohammed
kohail directly with senior saudi ministers and this case remains priority
for our government he added
canada does not have death penalty
haraki death came during fight between palestinian and syrian youths at the
edugates international school in an upmarket suburb of jeddah where sultan had
begun studying
mohammed kohail came to the defence of his younger brother after he was accused
of insulting syrian girl
kohail allegedly punched haraki who hit his head against fence fell to the
ground and died instantly
kohail later told canadian media he was forced to sign false confession and
in march he was sentenced to death which in saudi arabia usually means
beheading by the sword
ali kohail said he had few details about the ruling and what happens next
they will go to new court but when don know he said
he added that he was not sure if mohammed who remains in saudi prison knew
yet of the reprieve
maybe he knows he gets the newspaper in the prison he said
sultan meanwhile is staying at home with his family in jeddah
the case has already been referred back to lower court at least once
in late july or early august the case was pushed back reportedly to give the
families the chance to negotiate payment of diyah
in cases involving manslaughter or unplanned murders saudi courts and political
officials often urge diyah settlements to avoid execution
according to report in the arab news at the time haraki family had asked
for five million dollars while the kohail family said they were only able to
pay about dollars
