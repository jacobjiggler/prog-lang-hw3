but because of the law if male wants male line up we will have to provide
one he said that being said same as with any of our girls any sex worker
can refuse to do anything they do not wish to do with another customer
while nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal it is not legal in
counties with more than residents
that includes clark county where las vegas is situated and washoe county home
to reno the nearest legal brothel to las vegas is in pahrump more than
miles away
the border of nye county where shady lady is located is more than miles
from las vegas
in former hollywood madam heidi fleiss announced she would open male
brothel in nye county drawing international media attention but fleiss was
unable to get license because of prior felony convictions
some other brothel owners oppose the addition of male prostitutes on grounds the
state legislature may become uneasy with its potential for homosexual activity
and ban all prostitution
but dennis hof owner of the moonlite bunny ranch near reno isn concerned he
doesn think there much of market for male sex workers from either male
or female clients and predicts that the issue will wane once its modest economic
potential is determined
what woman with any money is going to go that three or four hours out of their
way to do this nobody said hof whose bordello is featured in the hbo reality
show cathouse year from now we going to have good laugh about
this
one man who does believe the male brothel idea will work is los angeles based
actor les brandt in he told reporters he was interested in becoming
fleiss first stud although now he disavows that notion and is focused on
legitimate acting career
still when he was in that spotlight he heard from hundreds of women who were
interested in taking advantage of such services
there are women lot of women who would like and need that option he
said some women need to pay for that affection that makes them feel human
there are some people who need that and there are some people who are willing
to be the tool to make that happen
halts of yemen transfers likely to slow guantanamo closure
washington jan afp
two weeks before the date set for guantanamo closure the notorious prison for
war on terror detainees remains open and pause in returning inmates to
yemen will likely slow its closure further analysts said
us president barack obama who last year set january as the date to
close the detention camp in southeast cuba declared on tuesday he had suspended
transfers of freed guantanamo bay inmates to yemen following the botched
christmas day airliner attack
thirty yemeni detainees the us government had deemed ready for release some of
whom are entering their ninth year there without charge are now being told to
wait even longer to return home
close to half of the detainees left at guantanamo bay are from yemen
seven yemeni detainees have already been sent home by the obama administration
including six in december several others were repatriated during george
bush administration
the halt of efforts to repatriate yemeni detainees from guantanamo will slow
the timing of guantanamo closure and may affect the way it is ultimately
closed matthew waxman former top pentagon official and now expert at the
council on foreign relations told afp
the administration has been reluctant to move detainees into the united states
for prolonged detention without trial but for many yemeni detainees it no
longer has viable alternative he said
the obama administration is under intense pressure from domestic critics not to
send more detainees back to yemen because of fears they will slip back into
extremism in the arab nation where obama says the thwarted bombing was planned
the clearance for release that the yemenis received are now meaningless legal
expert dalhia lithwick wrote in the online magazine slate
men poised to begin their ninth year of incarceration at the camp will remain
there not because anything they have done but in fear of whom they may meet on
the streets back home she said
the new twist then is that prisoners can now be held indefinitely not just
because they once knew terrorist but because they may meet one someday in the
future
obama this week sent an immediate message to critics who oppose his decision to
close guantanamo and many people abroad who support it saying he was determined
to follow through on his promise
make no mistake we will close guantanamo prison which has damaged our
national security interests and become tremendous recruiting tool for al
qaeda he said
in fact that was an explicit rationale for the formation of al qaeda in the
arabian peninsula obama said naming the yemen based group that he has blamed
for training and alleged bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab
the american civil liberties union said obama decision tuesday was unwise
unjust and will prolong shameful chapter in american history without making
americans any safer
human rights watch said that continuing to hold yemenis without charge only
increases resentment against the united states and hands al qaeda recruiting
tool
the administration task force is working to determine the fate of the remaining
prisoners at guantanamo including some of the most wanted terror suspects
some inmates will face trial before military or civilian courts and others will
be detained indefinitely because they are considered too dangerous to release
but cannot be tried because evidence against them is scant or tainted
obama has already acknowledged that some of the detainees still held at
guantanamo would be detained indefinitely
what the us knew about al qaeda plot
washington jan afp
us spy agencies in recent months picked up clues pointing to an al qaeda attack
out of yemen and were moving to disrupt it but crucial piece of information
fell through the cracks
intelligence officials describe trail of warning signs for the botched
christmas day attack on us bound airliner dating back to august when the
national security agency reportedly intercepted chatter among al qaeda
operatives in yemen
the nsa which runs an elaborate global eavesdropping operation heard
conversations from al qaeda figures describing plot to recruit nigerian man
for terrorist attack the new york times reported
the discussions about possible attack coincided with an alarming demonstration
of al qaeda growing strength in yemen
the same month bomber crossed from yemen and staged suicide attack against
saudi arabia anti terror chief prince mohammed bin nayef
the attack failed but saudi officials in october reportedly told president
barack obama top counter terrorism adviser that the bomber had sewn explosives
into his underwear the same tactic used in the christmas day plot
in september the head of the national counterterrorism center michael leiter
warned senate hearing that al qaeda had gained dangerous foothold in yemen
and was turning it into regional base for operations
sometime in october or november alhaji umaru mutallab the father of the
nigerian man accused of trying to blow up northwest flight approached us
embassy officials in abuja and told them he was worried his son had become
radicalized by extremists in yemen the times wrote
his son name umar farouk abdulmutallab was passed on to intelligence
agencies including the national counterterrorism center and entered into
vast data base of individuals with suspected links to militants or terrorist
groups officials said
but as the father apparently gave no indication that his son planned an attack
us authorities did not add abdulmutallab name to higher level terrror watch
list or to the no fly list designed to prevent suspected terrorists from
boarding aircraft
moreover state department officials remained unaware that abdulmutallab had
valid us visa due to misspelling of his name and therefore did not review his
visa status
by mid december senior intelligence officials hoping to derail possible
attack in the works reportedly ordered two waves of missile strikes against
al qaeda training camps in yemen
but they remained unaware of the pivotal information about abdulmutallab that
might have foiled the plot which was now at the final stage
at about the same time al qaeda targets were coming under missile fire in yemen
abdulmutallab reportedly purchased flight ticket with cash in ghana there are
conflicting reports if his ticket was one way or round trip
us border security officials had planned to question abdulmutallab upon his
arrival in detroit as part of standard procedure because his name appeared on
central data base that lists half million individuals said an administration
official who spoke on condition of anonymity
as we have indicated before there were bits and pieces of information about
abdulmutallab available in variety of areas in the system prior to december
he told afp
but us authorities had no plans to boot him off the plane taking off from
amsterdam as his name had not been added to the more critical terrorist watch
lists he said
former and current intelligence officials say the problem was not lack of
information but failure to manage it with the spy bureaucracy overlooking the
link between the chatter from al qaeda and the concerns raised over
abdulmutallab
intelligence work is not science it an art said former cia officer bruce
riedel
in retrospect it always simple you just look at couple of dots that all
made sense from the beginning and it all adds up but in the real world it
never that simple

turn up the heat to stay warm
football jones impressed with cardiff spirit
london jan afp
cardiff manager dave jones insists his players deserve credit for keeping the
club on course for the championship play offs in the face of mounting off field
problems
the bluebirds are reported to be facing second winding up order by her
majesty revenue and customs over an unpaid tax bill while an outbreak of
illness decimated jones squad for saturday draw with blackpool
despite those unpromising circumstances cardiff still earned point at home to
their play off rivals and remain in fourth place in english football second
tier
mark hudson gave them the lead with ninth minute header before charlie adam
equalised for blackpool early in the second half
there is lot of illness within the club but all the players did their best
under difficult circumstances jones said
towards the end of the match it began to have an effect as one or two of the
players ran out of steam but with everything that is going on at the club it
was fair result
as far as know cannot bring in any new players until the financial
situation has been settled
we are in the top six which is where we want to be yet no one ever writes
anything good about the club despite everyone here pulling their weight
scunthorpe demolished derby at pride park to move clear of the relegation
zone and leave rams boss nigel clough bemoaning his team lack of heart
this is as low as we have been for long time clough said we just don
seem to have the character out there at the moment to get back in the game
whether it is too much for some of them am not sure
there are some players who have been here two or three seasons who in the main
have lost matches
we are trying to get two or three in if there is other business to be done
hopefully we can get three or four in permanently
derby fell behind in the th minute when martyn woolford pass picked out gary
hooper and the striker slotted home his ninth goal of the season
garry thompson increased scunthorpe lead when miles addison failed to cut out
long pass allowing him to run clear on goal and fire past stephen bywater
scotland midfielder kris commons helped derby get one back when his th minute
shot deflected off marcus williams and trickled past goalkeeper josh lillis
scunthorpe put paid to any derby dreams of late fightback in the th minute
when michael connor broke down the right and pulled the ball back for thompson
to finish effeciently
jonathan forte bundled in loose ball with three minutes left to compound
derby despair

added second goal three minutes later
barnsley were back in the game in the th minute when jon macken got on the
scoresheet but substitute clinton morrison added late third to confirm the
visitors first defeat in nine league matches
even so coleman was unhappy with coventry display and he said that
probably the worst we have played for six weeks and for the first minutes we
were nowhere near the pace
at half time we told them that we had to improve even though we were two up

team if people don believe that then hopefully one day they will and soon
the teams had to battle bitter cold temperatures on the field which made
handling the ball difficult

fourth rookie quarterback in the past years to start and win an nfl playoff
contest
he just kept getting better as the season went along ryan said told him
this was his second season now his first season is over this is the playoffs
