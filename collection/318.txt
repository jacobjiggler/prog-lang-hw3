mancini with their fourth straight success even if they did concede their first
goal under the former inter milan boss when morten gamst pedersen scored for
rovers to make it
but the match belonged to argentina tevez who was in brilliant form as he made
it goals in his last nine games
the former manchester united striker opened the scoring in the seventh minute
and after micah richards superb second tevez struck two expert curling
shots the second in stoppage time to seal city win
city are now just seven points behind leaders chelsea and the big spenders
backed by their billionaire abu dhabi based owner sheikh mansour could yet have
big influence on the destiny of this season title
by contrast defeat left rovers just three points above the relegation zone with
all the teams below them having games in hand
as new signing patrick vieira the former arsenal midfielder who signed from
serie champions inter milan last week watched on from the stands city wasted
little time in giving the home crowd something else to cheer
rovers and england keeper paul robinson poor punch from martin petrov corner
fell to city striker benjani mwaruwari and the zimbabwean mishit shot went
into the net off tevez thigh
rovers looked as if they might go in at half time just goal behind until six
minutes before the break richards started and finished fine move with benjani
again involved in the build up
richards ran some yards from the heart of city defence beating several
retreating rovers players before passing to benjani inside the box
benjani shot hit the post but richards who continued his run slotted home
the rebound
rovers manager sam allardyce sent on strikers david hoilett and nikola kalinic
at half time but it was city who scored next just four minutes into the second
half
tevez started the move from inside the city half before finding benjani
rejuvenated figure under mancini who gave return ball to his fellow striker
then tevez raced towards the rovers area before unleashing magnificent yard
curling shot past robinson
tevez might have had hat trick in the th minute but his header from eight
yards out was off target
rovers pulled goal back minutes from time when pedersen made the most of
poor first touch by vincent kompany to beat shay given from yards
city fans then had to endure few nervous moments but importantly their
defence held firm for the remainder of the match and then in the first minute
of injury time tevez wrapped things up with sublime finish

gene linked to aggressive prostate cancer
washington jan afp
in first scientists have identified genetic variant linked to aggressive
prostate cancer that could improve diagnosis and treatments for the disease
researchers said monday
this finding addresses one of the most important clinical questions of prostate
cancer the ability at an early stage to distinguish between aggressive and
slow growing disease said the study lead author jianfeng xu cancer expert
at wake forest university baptist medical center in north carolina
although the genetic marker currently has limited clinical utility we believe
it has the potential to one day be used in combination with other clinical
variables and genetic markers to predict which men have aggressive prostate
cancer at stage when the disease is still curable
prostate cancer accounts for percent of all cancer diagnoses in the united
states aggressive prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death in the
country killing men annually
the researchers identified genetic variant rs associated with
percent higher risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer
single variant with moderate effect such as this is unlikely to be
sufficient on its own at predicting risk said xu but its identification is
significant because it indicates that variants predisposing men to aggressive
disease exist in the genome
as more genetic variants linked to aggressive prostate cancer are identified he
added men could likely be tested to determine their risk for the aggressive
form of the disease earlier in their lives so they can undergo increased
screening
identifying factors that are associated with risk of having or developing
aggressive disease is urgently needed to reduce over diagnosis and over
treatment of this common cancer said study co author karim kader wake
forest urologist
the study will be published online next week in the proceedings of the national
academy of sciences
researchers analyzed genetic information from men with aggressive prostate
cancer and with the slow growing disease to determine whether men with
aggressive disease shared genetic variants
the analysis included participants in the genetic markers of susceptibility
study performed by the national cancer institute as well as additional study
populations in the united states and sweden
aol to begin cutting jobs after volunteers run short
new york jan afp
us internet company aol said monday that it will cut jobs after voluntary
departure program failed to meet target of trimming one third of its global
workforce
the internet pioneer which was spun off from media giant time warner last month
after troubled merger had announced in november it would take million
dollar charge as part of restructuring as it regained independence
in december aol said the reduction in the workforce representing about
jobs was to be voluntary with involuntary layoffs to be used only if the
restructuring target were not met
we had approximately employees opt to join the voluntary program we
did not reach that target alysia lew an aol spokeswoman told afp in an
email
lew noted the involuntary layoff process varies by country internationally and
is subject to local laws
she said aol began meeting with employees monday throughout europe including in
britain germany and france
we announced plans to shut down many of our offices in europe beginning with
those in spain and sweden she said
the consultative process with the workers councils in relevant countries will
begin this week
in the united states the new york based aol said it would begin notifying
limited number of individuals affected by the layoffs monday with the majority
of the pink slips being delivered wednesday
the company is currently the number four gateway to the web after google
microsoft and yahoo while its dial up internet access business has been
gradually supplanted by high speed broadband services
time warner combined with america online in at the height of the dotcom
boom with aol using its inflated stock as currency for the transaction
time warner was forced in to massively write down the value of aol and the
aol name was removed from the group corporate title in

spain leads world in organ donations minister
madrid jan afp
spain led the world in organ donations in for the th consecutive year
despite sharp drop in road death fatalities key source of donated organs
health minister trinidad jimenez said monday
total of organ transplants were carried out last year in spain from
donors new record for the country she told news conference
the number of deceased donors per million people commonly used benchmark
stood at in almost double the recorded in the entire european
union
in the united states which pioneered organ transplant surgery it stood at
these results have enormous merit our numbers allow us to lead the world for
consecutive years jimenez told news conference
spain has become world leader in organ donation since it set up network of
transplant coordinators in at all hospitals in the country which closely
monitor emergency wards to identify potential donors
when they learn of death they tactfully talk to the grieving families to get
permission to harvest organs and help save the lives of others
the coordinators whose work was depicted in the oscar winning movie all about
my mother by spanish director pedro almodovar may spend hours listening to the
relatives and asking them to consider organ donation in private room away from
the hospital wards
only about percent of families approached in spain refused consent for organ
donation huge drop from the percent who refused in the before the
system was set up
at handful of hospitals the refusal rate is nearly zero percent
single decision to donate can help four patients who need kidney lung
liver or heart
spain is working in the european union to help introduce similar system across
the bloc
we want to extend to all nations of the european union the same conditions
of quality and security which spanish citizens enjoy and at the same time the
same levels of organ donation said jimenez
spain health ministry estimates that if the organ donation rate across the eu
were at the same level which it is in spain the number of donors in the bloc
could double to from just under in
this could save or improve the lives of at least more people each year
the ministry said
baseball baseball star mcgwire admits steroid use
los angeles jan afp
baseball legend mark mcgwire said on monday he used steroids during his record
breaking home run season in dealing another blow to the drug tainted image
of america national past time
in statement which confirmed long held suspicions about mcgwire hitting
exploits the year old former oakland athletics and st louis cardinals star
said he had used performance enhancing products throughout the
wish had never touched steroids it was foolish and it was mistake
truly apologize looking back wish had never played during the steroid
era mcgwire said in statement on the cardinals website
mcgwire had consistently declined to comment on drug use in baseball and in
refused to answer questions after being ordered to appear before congressional
hearing on steroid use in the sport
commissioner bug selig on monday welcomed mcgwire admission and said steroids
have been almost wiped out of the big leagues
am please that mark mcgwire has confronted his use of performance enhancing
substances selig said this will make mark re entry into the game much
smoother
the use of steroids and amphetamines amongst today players has greatly
subsided and is virtually non existent as our testing results have shown
the so called steroid era is clearly thing of the past
the burly slugger captured the imagination of american sports fans in after
becoming involved in gripping head to head battle with the chicago cubs sammy
sosa to break roger maris coveted single season home run record
maris mark of had stood since the but was obliterated by mcgwire who
finished the campaign with home runs sosa who has denied using
performance enhancing drugs finished with runs
however question marks have swirled about the legitimacy of mcgwire record
breaking season for years which the shamed baseball star admitted on monday was
fueled by illegal drugs
mcgwire said he had decided to come clean after being appointed the cardinals
new hitting coach two months ago
never knew when but always knew this day would come mcgwire said it
time for me to talk about the past and to confirm what people have suspected
used steroids during my playing career and apologize
remember trying steroids very briefly in the off season and then
after was injured in used steroids again used them on occasion
throughout the nineties including during the season
mcgwire said he had been drawn to steroids after becoming convinced they would
help him recover from series of injuries
during the mid went on the dl seven times and missed games over five
years
experienced lot of injuries including rib cage strain torn left heel
muscle stress fracture of the left heel and torn right heel muscle it
was definitely miserable bunch of years and told myself that steroids could
help me recover faster thought they would help me heal and prevent injuries
too he said
mcgwire acknowledged that his hitting feats would forever be questioned
following his admission of steroid use but insisted that he had enjoyed good
years when he had been clean
sure people will wonder if could have hit all those home runs had never
taken steroids he said
had good years when didn take any and had bad years when didn take
any had good years when took steroids and had bad years when took
steroids
but no matter what shouldn have done it and for that truly sorry
mcgwire insists he did steroids for nearly decade to recover from injuries and
not to try and cheat
you don know that you ll ever have to talk about the skeleton in your closet
on national level he said did this for health purposes there no way
did this for any type of strength use
mcgwire did not hold news conference on monday but rather chose to make his
admission in an online statement
the home run chase revitalized the baseball world but now mcgwire
admission has given the sport another black eye
his comments follow similar admission by new york yankees star alex rodriguez
months ago
major league baseball home run king barry bonds pitcher roger clemens and
slugger david ortiz have also come under suspicion for using performance
enhancing drugs but have denied knowingly doing so
bonds has been indicted on us federal charges he made false statements to
grand jury and obstructed justice
grand jury is probing clemens to determine if he lied to congressional
committee
in more than five percent of american baseball players tested positive for
performance enhancing drug use
the san francisco chronicle previously reported that bonds has admitted taking
steroids but says he did not know what they were
on march mcgwire and sosa were among several current and former
players who testified in front of the house government reform committee probing
drug use in baseball
