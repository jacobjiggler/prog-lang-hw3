us remote controlled spy drones used over afghanistan and iraq are producing so
much video intelligence that analysts are finding it more and more difficult to
keep up with it the new york times reported late sunday
the newspaper said the air force drones collected nearly three times as much
video over afghanistan and iraq last year as in about years worth
if watched continuously
that volume is expected to multiply in the coming years as drones are added to
the fleet and as some start using multiple cameras to shoot in many directions
the report said
group of young analysts already watches every second of the footage live as it
is streamed to langley air force base in virginia and to other intelligence
centers and they quickly pass warnings about insurgents and roadside bombs to
troops in the field according to the paper
but military officials also see much potential in using the archives of video
collected by the drones for later analysis like searching for patterns of
insurgent activity over time the times said
to date only small fraction of the stored video has been retrieved for such
intelligence purposes the paper said

hollywood web and gadgets winning mix at ces
las vegas nevada jan afp
premier consumer electronics show ces ended here sunday after rebounding
from global economic drubbing and wowing attendees with gadgets that merge
software entertainment and the web
ces is back analyst rob enderle of the enderle group in silicon valley said
of the annual event at which electronics makers from around the world gather to
display their latest creations
last year when left was thinking it the last ces it was morgue
device makers who felt the chill the fiscal crisis put on sales of consumer
electronics last year poured passion and innovation into proven products and hot
trends such at electronic readers and television sets
but this is one of the most exciting ces events we ve had in years said scott
steinberg lead technology analyst for digitaltrends com
there is innovation in terms of incremental gains instead of revolutionary
changes we are seeing baby steps and hints of giant steps to come
two silicon valley titans absent from the show floor left giant footprints on
the gathering of more than exhibitors
ces was awash in reader tablet and slate devices that in some cases seemed
hurried out to get jump on an islate that iphone ipod and macintosh
computer maker apple is expected to unveil later this month
think lot of the tablet buzz was trying to get upwind of apple said roger
kay president of massachusetts based endpoint technologies associates
it kind of game of chicken or leapfrog where you re investing or pretending
to invest in the tablet area in bid to try to claim it before someone else
gets there
host of device makers unveiled smartphones netbooks or tablets based on
google android software
google team had the internet star new nexus one smartphone available for
private meetings and on display one evening at an event in las vegas hotel but
not on the ces show floor
google was kind of the stealth company here enderle said google androids
were in devices all over the place
television makers who have seen prices driven down by competition and the
economy enthralled ces attendees by crafting eye grabbing and internet
services into high definition flat screen models
we ve seen pretty dramatic shift from hardware centric to software centric
gartner analyst van baker said of televisions unveiled at ces which ends
sunday
manufacturers are struggling with that increasing the value with software
implies service and it not an easy transition for them
internet pioneer yahoo added its software widgets to some televisions last
year at ces and built on that momentum this week with an expanded array of sets
and online services
it won be long before every tv is web connected in one shape or form whether
it technology in the tv or through set top box enderle said
they re all pushing this pretty hard
forrester research analyst james mcquivey said that tvs face an uphill
slog and it is unlikely consumers will rush to buy them after many upgraded to
high definition sets in the past three years
don think we are going to be wearing those glasses at home any time
soon steinberg said
growth of has been slow because of lack of programming the need for the
special glasses and the higher prices of sets
but last month release of science fiction blockbuster avatar film by
titanic director james cameron has renewed interest in the medium and espn
discovery and others announced plans this week to broadcast programming
in another nod to digital age tastes ces abounded with chips controllers and
other offerings tailored to enhance videogame play as far as making experiences
the consumer electronics association that runs ces estimated that more than
people attended the event in jump of more than percent from the
prior year final attendance figures won be available for several months
gartner expects consumer electronics sales to improve along with the economy

london jan afp
ipswich town manager roy keane believes the english second division championship
play offs are realistic target for his side despite yet another draw away
at promotion chasing leicester city
the visitors were goal up inside seconds at the walkers stadium on sunday
after ryan mcgivern under pressure from david norris put through his own net
but eight minutes before half time leicester striker steve howard equalised
remarkably it was the th time in league matches so far this season that
ipswich had drawn match
the result left them in th place and by no means out of relegation trouble
yet former manchester united midfielder keane said play off place was still
possibility for ipswich though they trail swansea the sixth placed team which
is the final spot for the play offs by points
disappointed we didn build on our great start to the game but know we
can do lot better than today
what we lack at the moment is that we don score enough goals and that an
area that needs improving
draws won get you too far up the table but still think we are capable of
having good season and that would include getting into the play offs
leicester manager nigel pearson whose fifth placed team are already very much
in playoff contention said it wasn very good game and we struggled to get
anything going
we didn look as solid as we have been in recent games we were too open and
they ipswich enjoyed some potentially dangerous situations
but at least we ve come out of it with something positive
only the top two sides at the end of the regular season are guaranteed automatic
promotion to the lucrative premier league with the third and last promotion spot
decided by series of playoff matches between the four next best placed teams

zagreb jan afp

politics over the past months turned to josipovic who had promised to usher in
the return of morals into politics
official results showed josipovic won over percent of the votes in sunday

overcoming corruption is key challenge if croatia which joined nato last
year wants to succeed in its bid to join the european union by and put
the trauma of the balkan wars of the further behind it
early in the presidential race observers predicted that josipovic would have
trouble connecting with voter but the bookish intellectual made the most of his
boring image by presenting himself as croatian mister clean untarnished by
political scandal
in debates the grey haired professor remained soft spoken never letting himself
be drawn out smiling benignly from behind his glasses he approached his rivals
as though he was addressing his students in law lecture
croatians bombarded by series of high level corruption affairs were longing
for president who brings sense of civil virtue to the table even if it is
sterile one analyst commented

australia warns china could extend rio exec detention
sydney jan afp
australia warned that china could extend the detention of rio tinto mining
executive stern hu on monday as chinese prosecutors faced deadline for
dealing with the case
trade minister simon crean said australia was waiting to hear the chinese
authorities decision which could include extending the probe proceeding with
the case or dropping the charges
he said canberra was making very strong representations about australian
passport holder hu who was arrested in july with three chinese colleagues and
initially accused of stealing state secrets
the accusations were later watered down to industrial espionage centring on
alleged bribery during high stakes iron ore contract talks
clearly there can be further extension but it also the case that they can
decide whether they re going to proceed or drop the charges crean told sky
news
we wait for that system to determine what the next step is we re not going to
advance it by making public calls one way or the other
we certainly continue to make very strong representations privately for this
case to be dealt with expeditiously openly and with due process served
hu was detained in shanghai on july and prosecutors have gained permission to
extend the probe twice most recently for two months in november
his arrest soured diplomatic relations and raised questions about dealing with
rapidly industrialising china the world biggest iron ore consumer
it came just weeks after mining giant rio snubbed massive cash injection from
chinese state firm and during annual iron ore contract talks which later
failed
rio an anglo australian company has said it does not believe its employees
have done anything wrong
tennis robredo looking to reach new heights
perth australia jan afp
with second hopman cup and victory over world no andy murray to his name
spanish veteran tommy robredo is heading towards the australian open full of
confidence
robredo was unbeaten in his four singles matches here en route to his second
title at the mixed teams tournament
the world no form improved with each outing during the week giving him
belief that he was ready for one of the best years of his career
he beat world no john isner and then was set up when romanian victor
hanescu retired
robredo then thrashed former world no lleyton hewitt in straight sets before
stunning rampaging murray who said he couldn have played much better by
coming from set down to win the final
the year old who had little time to celebrate as he was straight on plane
to auckland to complete his australian open preparations said his early season
form was even better than he expected
leaving here without losing any matches is great it better than was
expecting he said
tonight flying to auckland because next week playing another tournament
and want to keep playing my best
not going to stop now after winning this title so this is great but it
already the past
now we have to look forward for the next week for the aussie open which is the
most important tournament and the first grand slam one of the year
hopefully can keep playing like this and if do going to rise to the top
rank sure
at an age when many players would be lowering their expectations the spaniard
has set himself the goal of breaking new ground in the grand slams in as
well as returning to the top for the first time since
the remarkably consistent robredo who hasn been outside the top since
has five times reached the quarter finals of grand slam and on
occasions made the fourth round but never survived to the semis
last year he made the quarter finals at the french open the fourth round at
the australian and us opens and the third round at wimbledon
obviously as said all of the time in interviews did great thing on my
career all of the time to be on the top top all of my career he
said
so this is great achievement but never reached the semi finals in grand
slam so that the thing would like to try and that why working hard
every day
to finish grand slam knowing in the semi finals or in the finals or
winning never could achieve those things so looking forward to try this
and in week going to have the chance to play for that
going to be looking forward to do great thing in great tournament so
that my goal
