tsunami warning was in place for haiti cuba the bahamas and the dominican
republic with the first waves predicted to hit haiti shortly
the ambassador told cnn he was heartbroken as he had just spoken by telephone
with senior presidential aide who described scenes of chaos and devastation
he had to stop his car just about half an hour ago and take to the streets

clinton gets no commitment from japan on ending air base row
honolulu hawaii jan afp
secretary of state hillary clinton pressed her japanese counterpart here tuesday
to stick by deal on moving controversial us air base in japan but got no
commitment from tokyo during the meeting
at hastily arranged talks with foreign minister katsuya okada in honolulu
clinton said she had stressed the need to resolve the fate of the futenma base
but she also expressed confidence the row would be resolved saying tokyo
understands that the year old alliance with washington is fundamental to the
future of both japan and the region
have stressed again today that it is important to move on futenma
clinton said at press conference with okada in the garden of luxury hotel on
the pacific ocean
the meeting with okada was added to the beginning of an asia tour by clinton
who heads wednesday for papua new guinea and then continues to new zealand and
australia
we remain of the opinion that the realignment road map is the way forward she
said referring to deal to move the base from an urban area on the island
of okinawa to coastal region
okada reiterated that the new center left government of prime minister yukio
hatoyama will decide by may where to relocate the controversial base even if it
risks breaking up the ruling coalition
the new government is considering alternative sites for the base with various
options including moving it off okinawa altogether
the accord was part of broader realignment of us forces in japan and
includes the redeployment of around marines from okinawa to guam
soon after coming to power hatoyama center left government announced review
of the agreement provoking irritation in washington which has long guaranteed
security for japan
hatoyama junior partners in government the social democrats have threatened
to quit the coalition if it agrees to the original relocation plan
the united states which defeated japan in world war ii and then occupied the
country now has troops stationed there more than half of them on
okinawa the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the war
clinton said the us view is that agreement offers the best solution for
both the security of japan and the residents of okinawa
we want to get decision by may because much of the rest of the work around
the realignment roadmap has already proceeded the chief us diplomat said
the united states has already made decisions based on that roadmap which was
accepted by prior governments referring to the previous administration of
president george bush and the conservative government in japan
she did not answer question on whether she received an explicit commitment
from okada not to move the base off okinawa altogether
they understand our position that we want to see the realignment roadmap
carried through but we also have an appreciation for some of the difficult
political issues this government must address she said
she said she was confident the two sides would find solution that reflects the
very best of our alliance and provides the security guarantees japanese want
okada said we must make the alliance sustainable for the next years and
beyond
the security treaty signed on january has formed the bedrock of the
post war japan us alliance under which pacifist japan relies on massive us
military presence to guarantee its security
clinton will travel wednesday to papua new guinea for talks on climate change
and economic development before heading to new zealand and australia where she
will discuss similar issues as well as international security
making her fourth tour of asia since she became secretary of state year ago
the first stop of her first tour was in japan clinton is due back in

conan brien to quit if tonight show rescheduled
los angeles jan afp
conan brien threatened to quit nbc the tonight show on tuesday saying the
television network would destroy the program by moving its broadcast time to
new slot just after midnight
furious brien revealed in statement he had been told of the new airtime by
nbc chiefs following the decision to yank predecessor jay leno new talk show
from its prime time slot after months of dismal ratings
leno stepped down as host of the tonight show in may which he had taken
over from legendary long time host johnny carson in and was replaced by
brien as part of long standing agreement
leno surprised television industry analysts however by returning in september

however on sunday nbc confirmed leno show was being pulled from its coveted
pm gmt slot and would be given new minute window at pm
the space currently occupied by brien tonight show
brien broke his silence on the issue tuesday however vowing to resign his
multi million dollar hosting deal if the proposed rescheduling went ahead
after only seven months with my tonight show in its infancy nbc has decided
to react to their terrible difficulties in prime time by making change in
their long established late night schedule brien said
last thursday nbc executives told me they intended to move the tonight show
to to accommodate the jay leno show at for years the tonight
show has aired immediately following the late local news
sincerely believe that delaying the tonight show into the next day to
accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what consider to be
the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting
the tonight show at simply isn the tonight show cannot
participate in what honestly believe is its destruction
brien said he was still hopeful that the differences with nbc could be
resolved and said he had not received any offers from other rival networks

americans split on obama first year poll
washington jan afp
americans are deeply divided on barack obama first year in the white house
and the president ratings on priority issues health care and the economy have
hit new lows polls showed tuesday
polling also suggests independent voters are turning away from the president as
he nears the anniversary of his inauguration on january though in sign
of hope for his administration he remains more popular than his policies
cbs news poll showed obama job approval rating at percent marking the
first time he had polled below percent in the survey
cnn opinion research organization poll meanwhile showed obama approval
rating at percent but that was down three points in month
the percent job approval barrier is traditionally seen as crucial one for
presidents affecting their political standing and ability to attract support
for their policies in congress
when voters were asked in the cnn survey to rate obama performance during
crisis marred first year in the oval office percent said he had been
failure and percent judged him success
those results suggested that one of obama prime goals bridging political
divides in the united states had failed during his first year in office
though the president democrats accuse opposition republicans of serial
obstruction
after bitter year long debate obama and democrats in congress are moving
closer to passing sweeping health care reform bill but the polls show their
efforts have extracted painful political price
just percent of americans approve of obama handling of health care down
from percent in december and percent in october cbs said
in the cnn survey percent of those polled backed obama handling of health
care and percent disapproved in october percent approved and as far
back as last march percent of those polled endorsed his approach
it was similar story on the economy
forty four percent of those asked by cnn approved of obama stewardship of the
economy with unemployment at percent and credit squeeze still tight
new low for that survey
cbs news found percent backed obama economic management another new low
but the surveys found better news for obama on national security despite
withering republican attacks on his record following an al qaeda attempt to
bring down us bound jet carrying people on christmas day
according to cnn percent backed obama handling of terrorism cbs news put
that figure at percent and found that percent approved of the way obama
had managed the christmas attack compared to percent who disapproved
the keys to possible obama recovery after the likely passage of health care
reform and if the economy recovers were also evident in the polls
some percent of those asked by cnn said obama had the personality and
leadership qualities required of president
but the white house will be concerned by the finding by cbs news that obama
standing among independent voters whom he attracted in his election triumph
has fallen to percent decline of percentage points in the last few
months alone
supreme court weighs indefinite detention for sex offenders
washington jan afp
the us supreme court tuesday appeared divided on the constitutionality of
law allowing the federal government to detain some sex offenders after they have
served out their prison sentences
the law is being challenged by four men convicted of various sex crimes who were
ordered held after they completed prison terms and fifth man who was held
after being judged mentally incompetent to stand trial for sex offense
the us constitution grants american states the right to use police power to hold
citizens indefinitely if their release would pose significant threat to the
rest of the population though not all states use that power
but in congress passed legislation giving the federal government similar
power in the case of individuals deemed sexually dangerous
critics of the legislation which was signed by former president george bush
said it gave the federal government unconstitutional power
during an hour of oral argument tuesday us government lawyers said the
legislation was only intended to be used in cases where states did not assume
responsibility for civil commitment of convicts deemed likely to reoffend
this is not unusual that the state takes custody said solicitor general
elena kagan
if the state does not the federal government would ensure that the person will
stay in federal custody she added
but the court nine justices appeared sharply divided on the question and
cognizant of the implications of sanctioning indefinite detention on the basis
of potential criminal acts
justice antonin scalia questioned the government premise in arguing for the
detention power saying they had suggested it constitutional because it
necessary
but not sure it even necessary the conservative justice added
but attorney alan dubois arguing for the five men said the constitution
only allowed the use of detention as punishment for crime
so far lower courts have agreed ruling that the legislation is
unconstitutional the supreme court will rule on the case this spring
