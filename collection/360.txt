soldiers local resident mario zamora told afp
the arrest is second major victory for president felipe calderon
controversial clampdown on organized crime after top drug lord arturo beltran
leyva was killed in shootout with marines in raid south of mexico city on
december
calderon administration has also touted the arrest arturo brother carlos
beltran leyva on december in the drug plagued northwestern state of sinaloa
just two weeks after his brother death
garcia was not as powerful or influential as arturo beltran leyva but was
infamous for his extreme violence
he was officially part of the arellano felix or tijuana cartel but is now
suspected of fighting them for control of the border city across from san diego
in the united states
baja california authorities say garcia broke off an alliance with the arellano
felix cartel in january after bloody gunfight and now backs joaquin
shorty guzman head of the rival sinaloa cartel and mexico most wanted
man
garcia is suspected to be one of the country most violent drug traffickers and
blamed for wave of attacks in tijuana in recent years
hitman called the soup maker last year confessed to dissolving some
hundred bodies in acid for garcia
after his rivals killed his girlfriend in garcia allegedly went on
revenge killing spree murdering people including three children and five
police officers in hours
analysts said they hoped his arrest would held reduce violence in tijuana
think that levels of violence in tijuana will drop shortly security
consultant eduardo guerrero told afp
but many said the prospect of typical in fighting which takes place after the
removal of gang leader was also possibility and warned that violence could
result as drug cells were recomposed
more than people have died in spiraling drug violence in the past three
years across mexico particularly in northern border areas on lucrative
trafficking routes into the united states
tijuana with around violent deaths in is the country second most
violent city after the notorious border city of ciudad juarez
baja california sur home to tourist resorts like los cabos and la paz has much
lower levels of violence than the northern area of baja california where
tijuana is located
calderon has staked his presidency on tackling spiraling drug violence
authorizing the deployment of some troops across the country
police also arrested carlos beltran leyva on december in the drug plagued
northwestern state of sinaloa just two weeks after the slaying of his more
notorious and powerful brother arturo

raleigh north carolina jan afp
nine containers of highly explosive material spilled at major us port tuesday
forcing the north carolina facility closure and evacuation orders for nearby
town officials said
the accident happened around am gmt when forklift punctured
containers of the explosive during off loading morehead city mayor jerry jones
said
explosives experts from local marine base as well as police fire brigades
and the coast guard rushed to deal with the spilled chemical known as
pentaerythritol tetranitrate or petn which has featured in recent terror plots
petn which can be used in detonators and grenades is the same material that
was used in the botched christmas day bombing of northwest airliner en route
from amsterdam to detroit
it spilled on the ground jones said he said the petn was in crystal form but
was packed in water to reduce volatility we ve reduced the hazard it
getting manageable now he said
the blast zone has decreased from two miles km to one jones said the
section of highway is still closed and the voluntary evacuation of downtown
remains in place the mayor added
the petn was in kilogram drums wral television reported morehead city fire

nonfriction shovel something that will not create spark he said
petn is used as plastic explosive and also to treat heart conditions by itself
it is non explosive but can detonate easily if mixed with other materials
the port which lies just four miles seven kilometers from the atlantic ocean
is major export hub for phosphates it handles both breakbulk and bulk cargo
and is the second largest importer in the country for natural rubber
us officials have charged young nigerian umar farouk abdulmutallab with
trying to use petn as weapon of mass destruction onboard flight from
amsterdam on christmas day
the explosives failed to detonate correctly but caused an onboard fire as the
plane approached detroit burning abdulmutallab he has pleaded not guilty to
six charges arising out of the incident

the center said the warning had been issued to other caribbean nations for
information only at this time
spyker has funds to buy saab and gm is considering offer ceo
detroit michigan jan afp
spkyer has the money to buy saab and gm is considering its offer very
seriously the head of the dutch sports car maker said tuesday
decision on the bid can be expected in question of days not weeks said
victor muller founder and chief executive of spyker cars
the fate of the swedish car maker seemed sealed last week when gm chief ed
whitacre said the us auto giant had essentially given up on sale as nobody had
come up with the money to seal the deal
muller insisted the death knell has not yet rung
we have shown mr whitacre the money muller told an industry conference
hosted by automotive news in detroit
we are absolutely definitely negotiating in good faith with gm to buy saab
muller told conference hosted by automotive news in detroit
they are considering offers very very seriously
muller said he is not very concerned about all the steps that are being taken
with the wind down of saab because they are consistent with the plan gm set
forward after deal fell through with swedish sportscar maker koenigsegg
general motors announced on december that it would wind down the brand while
considering several last ditch bids for the iconic brand which has barely turned
profit during two decades under gm ownership
the bidders include spyker group comprised of formula one boss bernie
ecclestone and luxembourg investment firm genii capital and swedish group
fronted by the former chief executive of german truck manufacturer man and
former politician
if the sale of saab doesn generate more than the wind down scenario costs
for them it clearly not attractive muller said
so it was my job our job at spyker to put forward proposal that is
attractive enough for them to reverse the position
muller declined to provide many details of the offer but he said the swedish
government has been very helpful so far
the entire project would be fully funded to be able to continue as going
concern on stand alone base he told reporters on the sidelines on the
conference
saab presents number of opportunities for spyker including access to global
dealer network and the ability to reduce the cost of supplies and research and
development muller said
we re not interested in just buying an iconic brand we re interested because
it as business should be viable he said
our business plan clearly shows that saab of course having sufficient sales
can be very very sustainable and profitable company
spyker is currently spending tens of millions of dollars on outsourced product
development and muller said those engineering and research costs could be kept
in house if the automaker had the economies of scale offered by saab
several thousand people gathered for demonstration in sweden on tuesday to
call for saab to be rescued union official said
saab which employs people in sweden is one of four storied brands being
shed by gm as part of massive restructuring effort that began in and
accelerated last year when the largest us automaker went bankrupt
analysts have warned that some jobs could be lost with saab closure
muller said significant number of jobs could be created should spyker succeed
in its bid
we would be hiring rather than firing because the production capacity would
need to be improved rapidly he said

ireland parties hopeful of deal as crisis focuses minds
belfast jan afp
political parties in northern ireland expressed renewed hope tuesday of reaching
deal over policing powers despite scandal which has engulfed the province
leading politician
day after first minister peter robinson took six week break in the wake of
allegations about his wife affair with year old lover the parties struck
positive note after emergency talks on the policing and justice issue
robinson decision to stand aside has prompted concerns the once troubled
province already strained administration could collapse altogether
but both robinson democratic unionist party dup and their power sharing
partners sinn fein said they were determined to find solution to the vexed
issue of transferring policing powers from london to belfast
sinn fein president gerry adams refused to be drawn on the details of the
discussions but hinted that progress had been made on what is key piece of
the province devolution jigsaw
we believe that with political will these difficulties can be resolved adams
said
these discussions and it has to involve all of the parties but particularly
between ourselves and the dup are hugely important
the issues pre date the controversies of recent times
meanwhile finance minister sammy wilson of the dup expressed optimism that
deal could be done although he stressed many hurdles still remained
we are not going to minimise the difficulties that have to be faced but we will
seek to do this job do it as quickly as possibly and do it only once we are
sure we have secure foundation to have this important function
britain northern ireland minister shaun woodward met in dublin to discuss the
situation with irish foreign minister micheal martin late tuesday
after their meeting martin said britain and ireland were very encouraged now
by the recent engagement in the last number of days between the parties
we fervently hope that there will be very serious progress on the issues before
them and particularly on devolution of policing and justice within the coming
days he added
irish prime minister brian cowen will travel to london on thursday for talks
with his british counterpart gordon brown on northern ireland political
crisis an irish government spokeswoman told afp
robinson is facing questions over whether he can come back after his wife iris
admitted securing pounds euros dollars from two wealthy
developers to help her former lover kirk mccambley set up cafe
her husband insists he was unaware of her financial dealings he has attacked as
unfounded and mischievous allegations that he did know of them yet failed to
report it to officials
iris robinson also senior politician is currently receiving acute
psychiatric treatment
arlene foster the year old enterprise minister filling in for robinson
insisted he had only stepped aside temporarily
peter hasn left the scene he is still the leader of the party very clearly
and he is still the first minister she said
commentators fear the revelations over the robinsons could even trigger fresh
elections which polls show could produce majority for sinn fein
the dup which is protestant and wants northern ireland to remain part of
britain has since shared devolved powers from london in an administration
with socialists sinn fein which is catholic and wants the province to join the
republic of ireland
also weighing on the political crisis are fears of return to more frequent
violence in province where three decades of civil unrest killed at least
people the fighting was largely ended by the good friday agreement
last year two british soldiers and policeman were gunned down in attacks
claimed by dissident republicans in the latest incident friday catholic
police officer was left seriously injured when bomb exploded under his car

burkinabe president blaise compaore is acting as mediator between guinea new
strongman general sekouba konate the defence minister and the opposition
compaore was initially rejected as mediator last year by the guinean
opposition which considered him too close to the junta
but since then the junta has new interim leadership which has asked the forces
vives coalition of opposition parties trade unions and the civil society to
share power
recent un report on the stadium massacre in guinea capital conakry where
hundreds more were wounded and women and young girls were raped has underscored
efforts for peace
the un inquiry named camara as suspect in accusing the army of crimes against
humanity during the crackdown on the rally convened to oppose any bid by
camara to stand for president in elections then slated for january
early this month interim head konate went for week to morocco to see camara
whose medical condition is unclear and the united states france and moroccan
envoys all seized the occasion to meet the new junta chief
once the discussions were over rabat revealed that several working sessions
have been held directly with general konate or alternatively with senior french
and american officials

los angeles jan afp
mark mcgwire feels his place in history is secure despite calls from the family
of roger maris for major league baseball to recognize their father home run
achievements over his
mcgwire feels his legacy should be one of great long ball hitter because he
says he was naturally gifted athlete and didn need performance enhancing drugs
to break roger maris record of homers
mcgwire didn hesitate to blow his own horn when asked during mlb network
interview if he could have hit home runs in single season without steroids
look at what god gave me mcgwire told the network there is not pill or an
injection that will give an athlete the hand eye co ordination to hit
baseball
they still talk about home runs hit in high school
mcgwire admitted on monday that he used steroids on and off for nearly decade
including during the season when he broke the then single season home run
record he said he used drugs like androstenedione and human growth hormone to
rehabilitate his body from injury and not to cheat
but mcgwire also said the maris family have every right to consider their
father home runs with the new york yankees as the authentic record mcgwire
hit and then barry bonds surpassed him with in
both mcgwire and bonds have been linked to performance enhancing drugs leaving
the maris family to question whether their father should be considered the true
single season home run king
too many things have gone on and now this has come out rich maris the son of
roger maris told the san francisco chronicle think my dad still holds the
record
we think baseball will end up doing the right things with the records
we think baseball will get it right whether they restore or make some sort of
mark on what what
mcgwire called the widow of roger maris pat maris on monday before he went
public with his admission and rich maris said the family is willing to accept
his apology
he told her he had something to tell her rich maris said to the chronicle
he just wanted her to know the news was going to break and that he did
steroids
he apologized and that speaks volumes to the kind of guy he is
we love him like brother am glad he got it out
asked about the phone call on mlb network mcgwire said felt that needed
to do that they ve been great supporters of mine she was disappointed and she
has every right to be
mcgwire has been eligible for american baseball hall of fame for the past two
years he received minuscule percent of the vote from the baseball
writers association of america his first year on the ballot and this year

us backs plan for egypt wall with gaza
washington jan afp
the united states tuesday voiced its support for wall being built by egypt to
block network of tunnels stretching out from the gaza strip arguing it would
stop arms smuggling
we believe that weapon smuggling should stop and that measures taken to stop
that weapon smuggling should be could be carried out yes said state
department spokesman gordon duguid
the vast network of tunnels from gaza to egypt constructed in the sandy earth
to bypass crippling israeli blockade has become an economic lifeline for the
palestinians
the network has weathered israeli air strikes and egyptian attempts to flood
tunnels with water and gas but there are accusations that they are used to
smuggle weapons into the gaza strip run by islamic hamas militants
citing national security egypt is now building an underground iron wall in
new bid to tighten its porous sinai border with the restive palestinian
territory
cairo which states support for palestinians and has long mediated between
both israel and hamas and among palestinian factions has only implicitly
admitted constructing the iron barrier and has provided no details on its size
media reports however said it would be meters feet deep and
kilometers six miles long
but duguid stressed washington also supported greater access for humanitarian
supplies to get into gaza
there are established channels for that and those established channels should
not be hindered by hamas or any party in gaza
egypt at the weekend banned aid convoys bound for the gaza strip from traveling
