international fears about the nature of its nuclear program
enrichment is used to make nuclear fuel but also to produce the fissile core of
an atomic bomb
the six world powers gave tehran until the end of to accept deal brokered
by the un nuclear watchdog agency to ship most of iran low enriched uranium
leu abroad to be further refined into reactor fuel by russia and france

the baltic state
harry mannil died monday in the costa rican capital san jose edgar savisaar
mayor of estonia capital tallinn and close friend said in statement
savisaar paid tribute to mannil the godfather of his daughter as an
outstanding expatriate estonian businessman and did not mention the
accusations against him dropped by estonian prosecutors in
mannil nonetheless remained on wanted list drawn up by the simon wiesenthal
center los angeles based jewish organisation that tracks nazi war criminals
mannil then aged was recorded as having served from september to june
with the german security forces during the nazi occupation of estonia
the simon wiesenthal center accused him of involvement in the murder of
civilians mostly jews although an estonian probe only established that he was
involved in interrogations

prosecutors to halt their five year investigation on the ground that they had
failed to turn up evidence to implicate mannil in war crimes

but the nazis brought their own terror
estonia pre war jewish population numbered some most fled before the
nazi invasion in but the who remained in the country perished in
death camps

estonia where most died
the red army drove out the nazis in estonia remained soviet republic

mannil who in exile became wealthy businessman and art collector was
appointed foreign trade advisor by newly independent estonia government
he had first returned to estonia in at the invitation of local soviet
leader vaino valjas who had met mannil while serving as moscow ambassador to

switzerland main publicly owned salt works said tuesday that it had turned
down new orders from the snowbound netherlands and germany in order to cater for

china shows off air defences with anti missile test
beijing jan afp
china said tuesday it had successfully tested missile intercept system in what
analysts described as show of its advanced air defence capabilities amid
tensions over us arms sales to taiwan
china conducted test of ground based mid range missile interception
technology within its territory which achieved its objective foreign ministry
spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters
this test is defensive in nature and not targeted at any other country and is
consistent with the national defence policy of china jiang said
the news comes soon after us official in taipei said the pentagon had approved
the sale of patriot missile equipment to taiwan as part of package passed by
congress more than year ago
beijing which considers taiwan part of its territory and has vowed to take
the island back by force if necessary has repeatedly voiced its opposition
to the sales and urged washington to cancel the deal
china defence ministry had warned at the weekend that it reserved the right to
take unspecified action if washington followed through with the sale which it
called severe obstacle to china us military ties
the us defense department said china did not give it advance notice of the test
we did not receive prior notification of the launch said pentagon spokeswoman
major maureen schumann
the us is requesting information from china regarding the purpose for
conducting this interception as well as china intentions and plans to pursue
future types of intercepts she said
the united states is the leading arms supplier to taiwan even though it
switched diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing in
but analysts said while china test would keep pressure on the united states
over the taiwan deals it was likely to have been conducted as general show of
force
it sounds pretty significant to me richard bitzinger an expert on china
military at nanyang technological university in singapore told afp
the information is pretty thin but the critical fact is that they conducted
successful missile intercept
scott harold an analyst at the rand corporation agreed saying would be
inclined to view the test as stride but how much of one is unclear in the
absence of more information towards missile defence capability
arthur ding an expert at taiwan national chengchi university said the test
would send political signal to the united states and to other countries that
china is prepared for air operations full scale operations by whatever
country
there is no detailed information so it is very hard to assess how much china
has achieved but at least it can show trend that air defence is an area of
focus for the overall military modernisation he said
beijing has poured money into its military in recent years as part of major
drive to upgrade the equipment used by the nation million strong armed
forces
china military spending rose percent in to billion dollars
according to budget submitted to parliament in march the latest in more than
decade long string of double digit increases
but amid growing concern overseas about china military intentions beijing
frequently stresses the defensive nature of its armed forces
china defence modernisation is for the legitimate needs of safeguarding
national sovereignty security and territorial integrity jiang said tuesday
the global times quoted senior military strategist yang chengjun as saying that
the test had ushered china into new phase in terms of missile interception
technologies
china needs an improved capability and more means of military defence as the
country faces increasing security threats yang was quoted as saying
one western military expert based in beijing who asked not to be identified
told afp what important is that they showed their willingness to demonstrate
china capabilities
ding said the latest military display could not be compared to test that
saw china destroy one of its own orbiting satellites with missile sparking
international concerns
that test came after the united states under former president george bush
announced plan to weaponise space move opposed by beijing and moscow

she was sentenced to years imprisonment combined with years of probation
and psychological monitoring the court also awarded euros
dollars in damages to mugnier family

university and failed to hold down any job for long the court heard
she also made several suicide attempts once using the same knife she killed
mugnier with to slash her wrists and thighs
davies looked relaxed after the sentence was given appearing to joke with her
police minders
she had told the court earlier want to express the extent of my remorse
take responsibility and accept the consequences of what did
she earlier told the court in versailles she had blacked out and had no
recollection of the killing except the sensation of the knife going in
do not even dare ask forgiveness from olivier family she said tuesday
the second and last day of her trial what did terrifies me can
guarantee that will never again touch drop of alcohol
she told the court monday that she remembered telling the police who arrived at
the murder scene that was monster
she said she no longer remembered making statement the day of the murder in
her flat in saint germain en laye in which she said just wanted to cut him
little but the knife went in by itself
the blood stained kitchen knife with six inch blade that killed mugnier was
passed round for inspection by the three judges and the five women and four men
of the jury
davies said she had begun the weekend that mugnier died by sleeping with an ex
boyfriend on the friday night
she spent most of the saturday drinking in series of bars with friends before
going alone to sullivan irish pub near her home where she met and began
flirting with mugnier
they had several drinks and when the bar closed decided to go to davies place
opened bottle of wine he rolled joint we started undressing making
love she told the court
he couldn have proper erection but that was understandable given how
much we drunk we stopped making love he took off the condom said davies
the next thing she knew mugnier was lying bleeding from the neck on the bed
and she was trying to stem the blood with one hand and calling emergency
services with the other
mugnier succumbed to two knife wounds one of which proved fatal after it went
right through his body and touched his spine
