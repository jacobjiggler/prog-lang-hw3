dead as mudslide hits rio hotel
rio de janeiro jan afp

island southwest of rio de janeiro friday killing at least people and
leaving many others missing amid tons of mud and debris

landslide
based on our conversations with neighbors the number of victims could reach
colonel pedro machado fire chief told cbn
about rescue workers and firefighters wrestled to remove the mud and
vegetation in the slim hope of finding survivors
machado earlier said the chances of finding survivors are very slender
because the houses and the hotel are under tons of mud the rescue work is more
difficult we cannot use heavy equipment because of the risk of setting off new
landslides he said
authorities said most of the bodies recovered earlier were found on land but at
least three had been pulled from the sea
the hotel sankay which opened in catered to brazilian and foreign
tourists looking for hard to reach beachside hideaway

football mcdonald backs ki for celtic success
glasgow jan afp
australian international striker scott mcdonald believes celtic new south
korean star ki sung yueng can handle the old firm heat if he plays against
rangers on sunday
mcdonald has been impressed with ki both on and off the pitch and has no
fears over the former fc seoul player settling into the scottish top flight
played against south korea for australia friendly win for korea just
after ki deal had been agreed and had good chat with him it was good to
be able to welcome him to the club said mcdonald of the year old who will
be world cup rival in south africa in the summer
ve been chatting to him over the last few days and he spent three years in
australia when he was younger so he knows about me and my country
he fitting in well speaks perfect english and seems to be really good
player was certainly impressed with him when he played for south korea
can see him making his debut against rangers you just never know we ve seen
some surprise debutants before in derbies so we ll wait and see what the
manager decides mcdonald told the official celtic website
celtic have game in hand over rangers but go into sunday match seven points
behind their great rivals
mcdonald knows the game is key to cutting the gap in the title race as well as
boosting his hopes of finishing as club top scorer this season
he has to his name so far but his best season was in when he grabbed
you make your own luck by working hard that what do got
goals so far and it not bad return at this stage of the season but
love few more he said
football ancelotti shrugs off african talent drain
london jan afp
chelsea boss carlo ancelotti shrugged off losing didier drogba john mikel obi
michael essien and salomon kalou to the african nations cup claiming the
tournament may have come at the right time
the premier league leaders tackle watford in the fa cup third round on sunday
before games against hull sunderland birmingham and burnley during january
when the african event takes place in angola
despite the three week nations cup ancelotti said he would not be put off
signing another african player in the future
he said think that when they have to play for their national team it not
problem it like the european players
every top player can go to the national team it not problem for the
africans it ll be great opportunity for the young players now to show their
quality hope they will do very good job because trust in these players
ancelotti will have his first taste of fa cup football this weekend and the
italian is already aware it has markedly different flavour in england compared
to his homeland
there domestic knockout competitions are all but ignored with even clubs like
ac milan and juventus who have both had spells with ancelotti at the helm
going through the motions in front of sparse crowds
many believe the fa cup no longer has the place in english hearts it once
enjoyed but nonetheless ancelotti knows the famous trophy remains worth
fighting for as chelsea proved last season when they came back from behind to
beat everton in the final
it is very important competition in england ancelotti said in italy the
italian cup is not so important
we want to do our best and it is one of our objectives our aim to win it
last year we won it we want to do the best again this year
championship side watford are the visitors to stamford bridge on sunday and
ancelotti will not need reminding that stumble at this hurdle precipitated
former chelsea boss luiz felipe scolari exit almost year ago
chelsea were held at home by southend united third tier league one team and
although the replay was negotiated successfully the brazilian was dismissed in
february just month later
ancelotti admitted he knew little of watford save he is big fan of their
former chairman pop star elton john but promised he would step up the research
soon
watford are good team he said don know them very well but have an
opportunity to watch dvd every team can give you problems if you don stay
focused
watford whose manager malky mackay became permanent appointment before the
season started when former chelsea academy coach brendan rodgers left for an
ill fated spell at reading are mid table in the championship
but as well as hoping to cause an upset they will also be using the fixture as
an opportunity to bring in much needed funds after the club almost went into
administration earlier in december
this was avoided when former chairman jimmy russo and his brother vince received
repayment of loan of almost five million pounds
football arsenal west ham superkids put friendship aside
london jan afp
jack collison faces fellow wales midfielder aaron ramsey on sunday in an
intriguing subplot to west ham fa cup showdown against arsenal
both youngsters boast huge potential but their club paths have headed in
dramatically different directions this season with west ham battling relegation
while arsenal are pushing for the premier league title
and collison admits he is one of ramsey biggest fans
aaron is real class act got chance to play with him for the wales under
when we had real good run in the european championship qualifiers so am
not surprised at all how well he has done he is so good on the ball and works
so hard said collison
am sure that at club like arsenal and under manager like arsene wenger
he is going to really keep improving and over the next few years you will see
great things from him
it is hard to get your opportunity but you have to keep working hard and take
the chance when it comes
have done my best to do that and am enjoying my football just trying to
improve for west ham as best as can
meanwhile wenger admitted he is ready to sacrifice arsenal fa cup hopes to
keep their premier league title challenge on track
wenger has won the cup four times during his years in north london and the
club last major silverware came in the competition back in
yet the french coach has no intention of letting fond memories of the tournament
distract him from keeping his players fresh for wednesday crucial home league
game against bolton
arsenal are firmly back in the title race after their win at portsmouth in
midweek and victory over the managerless trotters would close the gap on
leaders chelsea to just one point
with that in mind wenger is prioritising the league and plans to send out an
under strength side at upton park even if this means his team being eliminated
at the first hurdle
cesc fabregas robin van persie theo walcott and denilson are all sidelined
through injury but wenger will also rest several other players as the likes of
mikael silvestre and lukasz fabianski get rare outings
will have to rest some players that is for sure wenger said we want to
win but we want to protect our home games against bolton and everton as well
to keep the momentum going
the premier league is always more important than the fa cup the premier league
is so hard that you want to take care of your position
at the moment we have to keep our spirit and our attitude then we have
chance
season is judged on the overall achievement and people look to who has won
the trophies but also look at how we have done and how consistently we have
played
although wenger will shuffle his starting line up he insists he has enough
respect for the cup not to send out the kind of youthful team that he regularly
employs in the league cup
for us the league cup is exclusively for young players and the fa cup is one
to win he added
but we have worked for that policy and it is not coincidence there is four
or five years of hard work and patience behind that
we have so many players that we have hard time finding them chance to
play
west ham manager gianfranco zola is more concerned by his side league position
than aiming for success in the cup and with long battle against relegation
looming the italian could also rest key players
only goal difference is keeping the hammers out of the relegation zone after
monday defeat at tottenham and zola knows his team need to show more of the
battling qualities that helped them fight back from two goals down to draw with
arsenal earlier this season
zola could hand young striker frank nouble first start in place of suspended
