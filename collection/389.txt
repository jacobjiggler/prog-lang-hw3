future growth
the company raised its outlook for revenues expressing confidence that business
income would improve in coming quarters but said the rise in the rupee against
the dollar was concern
the percent decline in earnings to billion rupees million
dollars during the three months to december allowed the firm to increase its
forecast for the full year to the end of march
analysts had estimated profits for the nasdaq listed firm would be near
billion rupees for the quarter
infosys shares rose percent or rupees to rupees in late
afternoon trade tuesday after the earnings were announced
revenues by indian accounting standards for the bangalore based outsourcer
fell percent to billion rupees it said in statement to the mumbai
stock exchange
by us accounting norms infosys said net profit grew by marginal percent
to million dollars for the december ended quarter
the company raised its full year guidance forecasting revenues in the range of
and billion dollars for the fiscal year ending march to
percent rise
the global economic recovery seems to be led by the us and the financial
services said gopalakrishnan chief executive of infosys in statement
even though it budgets are expected to be flat in offshore outsourcing is
expected to benefit from this recovery
infosys added new clients and net employees in the quarter
the earnings were better than expected the guidance is also strong gaurav
dua head of research with local brokerage sharekhan told afp
strong volume growth and higher staff recruitment are all positive signs for
the future
infosys said it saw strong growth in markets it had recently entered having
incoporated in the third quarter its wholly owned brazilian subsidiary and
opened its first office in wellington new zealand
the results clearly show the worst is behind and recovery started
gopalkrishnan told reporters on tuesday
no one predicted recovery will be so fast just as no one saw that the meltdown
would be so rapid
on the flip side currency volatility in the short term is going to be
challenge he added
india rupee has surged to month high against the dollar currently
quoting at foreign currency earnings of india software companies get
impacted as they bill their us based clients in dollar terms
infosys said it expected better as investments in infrastructure
manpower training sales and marketing would improve
the results suggest that recovery has set in and the big four software firms
could break away from the pack said viju george analyst with edelweiss
securities
india largest software exporter tata consultancy part of the tea to steel

nouakchott jan afp

kidnapped on december last year by al qaeda in the islamic maghreb
sergio cicala and his burkina faso born wife philomene kabore were

taiwanese president to stop over in us report
taipei jan afp
taiwan president ma ying jeou is set to stop over in the united states during
visit to honduras this month local media reported triggering an angry
response from china
the report came just days after the united states unveiled plans to sell missile
equipment to the island which china considers part of its territory and amid
brewing us taiwan dispute over beef imports
china which on tuesday said it had successfully tested missile interceptor
system reacted to the report by warning the united states against having any
official contact with ma during the stopover
we oppose any official contact between the united states and taiwan we urge
the united states to handle the issue in prudent and proper way said
chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu
ma is expected to hold private talks with us congressmen during stops in
california on controversial decision by taipei to re impose an import ban on
certain us beef products taiwan tvbs cable news channel said
he will leave taiwan on january for the inauguration of honduran president
elect porfirio lobo sosa two days later with transit stop in san francisco
said the state funded central news agency
he will make another stopover in los angeles before returning home on january
the trip will be his fourth to latin america aimed at bolstering ties with
the region since taking office in the report said
ma had made transit stops in the us on the previous latin america tours but kept
them low profile in line with his china friendly policy
beijing opposes any overseas visits by officials from taiwan which it has
threatened to take back by any means possible including war if need be
this time china anger could be worsened by the fact that the pentagon last
week approved the sale of patriot missile equipment to taiwan as part of
package passed by congress more than year ago
china over the weekend warned it reserved the right to take unspecified action
if washington followed through with the sale and tuesday said it had tested
ground based mid range missile interception technology
washington remains the leading arms supplier to the self ruled island despite
switching diplomatic recognition from taipei to beijing in
taiwan foreign ministry spokesman james chang declined to comment on ma
reported trip saying details were yet to be finalised
honduras is among only countries that formally recognise taipei instead of
beijing almost all of them are developing nations in africa latin america and
the pacific
indonesian govt red faced over prison perks
jakarta jan afp
the indonesian government which has promised to stamp out corruption was
embarrassed by revelations tuesday that rich and powerful prisoners are living
in luxury behind bars
details of the perks for influential inmates were front page news after team
established by president susilo bambang yudhoyono to probe judicial corruption
conducted snap inspection of women jail in jakarta
businesswoman artalyta suryani convicted last year for bribing prosecutors was
reportedly interrupted in the middle of laser beauty treatment in her
square metre square foot apartment style cell
her perks included double bed air conditioning flat screen television
refrigerator private kitchen and bathroom and playpen for children
according to the jakarta globe newspaper
we deeply regret that several prisoners might have received special treatment
presidential spokesman julian aldrin pasha told afp
president yudhoyono believes that all inmates should receive equal treatment
there shouldn be any privileges or special dispensations for prisoners
yudhoyono has promised to crush what he has called the court mafia that runs
the country judicial system although critics say his fact finding team lacks
authority and point to yudhoyono failure to take more decisive action
the ex general won re election in july but his second five year term has been
hit by steady flow of scandals that have cast doubt on his oft repeated
promises to tackle pervasive corruption
all the problems related to the judicial mafia can be solved overnight
pasha said
justice and human rights minister patrialis akbar suspended the head of the
pondok bambu bamboo hut women prison in jakarta that was inspected by the
fact finding team and promised to reshuffle other prison chiefs
this would prevent them creating their own kingdoms by selling favours and
privileges he added he made no promise to prosecute any prison chiefs who had
profited from such illegal behaviour
it is well known in indonesia that wealthy and powerful inmates are able to buy
special treatment and even shorter sentences while the poor and vulnerable are
crammed into overcrowded cells and subjected to extortion and abuse
an anonymous former inmate told metro tv that new prisoners faced torture in the
form of daily beatings unless they paid money other prisoners worked with the
guards to extort money from newcomers he said
when was new was asked for money but didn have any the consequences
were painful was beaten up every day he said
the most expensive fee for privileges like was two million rupiah
dollars month but everything is negotiable
the son of late dictator suharto reportedly enjoyed luxuries including four fish
tanks and personal staff although he was convicted of killing supreme court
judge
one of six children hutomo tommy mandala putra suharto served just third of
year jail term for the murder he was released in october and made an
unsuccessful bid to run for president last year
yudhoyono pledged to crack down on the court mafia late last year after police
and prosecutors were caught allegedly conspiring to frame two senior anti graft
investigators on behalf of corrupt businessman
one of the prosecutors has resigned without further punishment while the chief
detective at the centre of the scandal remains on the force and no action has
been taken against the so called broker who acted for the businessman

the taliban militants

of our structures believe we are on the way to convincing the afghan people

london jan afp
miguel marcos michel the spanish midfielder who has become birmingham first
signing since carson yeung takeover of the club will not be rushed into
premier league action blues boss alex mcleish has signalled
michel who completed three million pound transfer from sporting gijon on
monday faces battle to establish himself in midfield in which experienced
pair barry ferguson and lee bowyer have been outstanding in birmingham
match unbeaten run
and mcleish believes his newest recruit will need time to settle into english
life and football
sometimes it not easy for player especially coming from foreign country
to come in and hit the ground running the former scotland boss said
he ll need time to get to know his team mates and see the sort of demands we
ask from players in training
we can also see if we can add wee bit to his game and improve him all round
as player
but the bonus is that because we re doing so well he has got additional time
to settle
mcleish first attempted to sign michel before the start of the season and he was
releived that yeung financial backing finally made the deal possible
very pleased he signed as ve been tracking him for over year the
scot added ve added player who is unfazed in taking the ball in any
company
he played at the bernabeu and the nou camp and has acquitted himself well so
he technical player who can definitely strengthen the squad
he has good quality is only has got good legs and is player for now but
also the future
stoke have agreed to loan former captain andy griffin to championship club
reading until the end of the season griffin has made only three
appearances for stoke this season all of them in the league cup
there is lot of competition for places in the squad and andy is obviously
desperate to play first team football said potters boss tony pulis move to
reading is great opportunity for him to go out and play regularly in the
championship
aston villa boss martin neill meanwhile has assured nicky shorey the former
england full back who is thriving on loan at nottingham forest that he is not
planning to off load him permanently
neill said selling nicky is not something that am looking to do at this
minute and nothing concrete has developed if there was an offer would sit
down with nicky and his agent to discuss it but am not actively seeking to
sell him
shorey was loaned to forest after losing his place in the villa line up to
summer signing stephen warnock but neill believes the defender may yet live up
to his early promise
think going forward he has done very well and if he tightens up his game
defensively he has loads to offer the villa manager added
