indonesian military business empire poses threat hrw
jakarta jan afp
indonesia military has failed to dismantle its dangerous business empire as
ordered under law designed to enhance civilian rule in the budding
democracy human rights watchdog said tuesday
promises of increased oversight by president susilo bambang yudhoyono market
friendly ex general were totally inadequate and left the military
unaccountable to government human rights watch hrw said in report
it outrageous that despite the parliamentary directive the government has no
plan to take over ownership or management of single business hrw researcher
and report author lisa misol said in statement
promising to monitor them more closely simply isn good enough
despite law ordering the military tni to get out of the business sector
by the end of the generals still control foundations and over
cooperatives including ownership of companies the report says
these interests had gross assets worth million dollars in and turned
profit of million dollars according to official figures cited by the
report
yudhoyono issued decree on october promising greater oversight but hrw
said the measures merely entailed partial restructuring of the business
entities and required no divestment
an inter ministerial oversight team established on november has no clear
authority lacks independence and is not required to report publicly hrw said
nor do the new measures address accountability for human rights violations and
economic crimes associated with military business activities it added citing
examples including the killing of protesters by military personnel
in in pasuruan east java hrw said navy personnel opened fire on villagers
who were protesting over expropriations of land by the navy decades earlier
killing four
the sailors were providing security for state owned company that had leased
the land from the navy to operate plantation
in other examples the military has had prominent role in large timber
operations that have displaced communities from their ancestral lands and
fuelled rampant illegal logging it said
military units providing protection services to companies have earned off
budget cash payments raising serious corruption concerns the military also
has been implicated in illegal businesses and extortion operations
spokesman for yudhoyono refused to comment on the hrw report and military
press officers were unavailable
hrw said money making ventures by the military contribute to crime and
corruption impede military professionalism and distort the function of the
military itself
former defence minister jowono sudarsono admitted last year that rogue
elements of the military could be behind spate of shootings targeting
employees of us miner freeport mcmoran in eastern papua province
unidentified gunmen ambushed and killed an australian mine worker and two
indonesians including policeman in july near freeport massive gold mine
which pays troops for protection
sudarsono rejected suggestions of direct military involvement and police have
blamed poorly armed papuan separatists but the mine has long been linked to
alleged human rights abuses by the security forces
during his tenure as defence minister from the time yudhoyono took office in
until last year sudarsono argued the military should be allowed to keep
its smaller business interests to support soldiers families
the task of bringing the indonesian military fully under civilian control
remains incomplete more than decade after the collapse of general suharto
military backed dictatorship

australian research says tv can kill
sydney jan afp
people who spend more than four hours in front of the television each day have
far higher risk of dying early than those who limit their viewing an australian
study said tuesday
watching the small screen for prolonged periods is also bad for your heart
according to the research published in the journal of the american heart
association
compared to people who watch less than two hours of television per day people
who watch more than four hours per day have percent higher risk of death
from all causes researcher david dunstan told afp
they also have an percent increased risk from cardiovascular disease he
said
sitting down for long periods stops the body from using its muscles and
adequately processing sugars and fats dunstan said
the findings come from six year study into the viewing habits of some
australians which stripped out the influence of other health factors such as
age sex smoking weight and exercise
australians watch an average of three hours day said dunstan researcher
with the melbourne based baker idi heart and diabetes institute
the study found that even people who exercised regularly were potentially
hurting their bodies by sitting down for extended periods he said
what these findings suggest is that in addition to regular exercise people
need to consider avoiding prolonged periods of sitting whether it in front of
the television working long hours or driving for prolonged periods
and for tv specific message could be switch off stand up and keep moving
the researcher said

football wounded eagles wary of falling prey to the cup curse
lubango angola jan afp
zambia are out to continue the tradition this africa cup of nations is fast
gaining of producing shocks against tunisia in their group clash here on
wednesday
tunisia turned up in angola wounded from missing out on world cup berth at the
last throw of the qualifying dice
the carthage eagles who won the nations cup on home turf in led nigeria
for five world cup qualifying rounds only to lose in mozambique and be overtaken
by super eagles team that grabbed late nairobi triumph over kenya
coached by local man faouzi benzarti who was snapped up after being sacked by
libya tunisia are seeded to go through with group favourites cameroon ahead of
zambia and gabon
but evidence from the opening shots in this competition nothing can be taken for
granted with angola letting slip four goal lead against mali algeria falling
to malawi and burkina faso holding favourites ivory coast to goalless draw
benzarti said as we have seen the first games are very difficult even if
zambia are classed as outsiders
we will have to be careful and concentrate on the game to get the first three
points which will be good for our team in the next two matches especially
against cameroon who are the group favourites
there are no bad teams in africa they re all on the same level may the best
one win
the new man in charge added approaching this in very positive spirit as
can countenance the notion of defeat
the aim is to qualify from the first round and then we ll see after that
benzarti men are out to better their last two quarter final exits in the
biennial african competition
their hopes of progress in angola will in part rest on playmaker oussama
picasso darragi
the former national reject has become an instrumental figure and gets on well
with the coach who was in charge of him at tunis club giants esperance
germany based defender karim hagui is the lone survivor from the title
winning squad
tunisia go into the game on the back of surprise loss to gambia last
saturday in warm up match with their sole goal coming from armine chermiti in
the fourth minute of injury time
tunisia ranked rd in the world are making their th appearance in the
africa cup of nations which puts them on par with zambia whose best showings
have been two runners up spots in and
zambia are skippered by christopher katongo who knows thing or two about the
command structure from his time as lusaka based national army corporal
he was promoted to sergeant after devastating hat trick against south africa
in qualifying for the cup
now professional with german second division outfit arminia bielefeld
christopher who will need to rediscover his scoring touch after one goal in
qualifying is joined in the squad by his younger brother felix
zambia are coached by herve renard who gained invaluable experience for angola
as an assistant to the then ghana coach claude le roy in
zambia big problem is their scoring record which by all accounts was abysmal
with only four goals in qualifying games
renard knows he must unlock zambia attack if his side are to have any chance
of causing an upset in group that houses potential champions cameroon and
gabon
american airlines raises stakes in jal bidding war
tokyo jan afp
american airlines on tuesday upped the ante in bidding war with rival delta
air lines for stake in japan airlines which is teetering on the verge of
bankruptcy
american airlines and its partners lifted their proposed investment in asia
biggest carrier to billion dollars from previous offer of billion
dollars the us carrier announced at tokyo news conference
american has teamed up with its oneworld alliance partners and private equity
company tpg to woo jal which has also been offered one billion dollar
financial package from delta the world largest carrier
american and delta are competing to tie up with jal and increase their share of
the lucrative asian market
this proposal demonstrates oneworld extraordinary commitment to jal
american airlines executive vice president thomas horton said in the statement
it brings stability and certainty to japan airlines at time when it is most
needed as it faces turbulent times over the coming weeks and months
delta which belongs to the skyteam airline alliance is seeking to lure jal
away from the oneworld grouping
jal shares dived almost percent in early trade on tuesday battered by
deepening fears that investors will see their stakes wiped out under widely
expected bankruptcy filing
media reports said that the debt ridden airline is likely to be delisted from
the tokyo stock exchange
jal which lost about billion dollars in the six months to september is
seeking its fourth government bailout since to enable it to keep flying in
the face of mounting debts

clinton plays down row over air base
honolulu hawaii jan afp
us secretary of state hillary clinton sought to defuse dispute over us air
base in japan as she arrived in hawaii for tuesday talks with her japanese
counterpart katsuya okada
launching her fourth asia tour since becoming the chief us diplomat year ago
clinton also said washington intends to exercise influence in asia for another
century and serve as stabilizing force against china rising power
clinton speaking to reporters on the way to honolulu monday on the eve of talks
with okada played down the dispute over the relocation of the futenma air base
on okinawa that has caused tension in the post war alliance
the significance of our meeting is to reaffirm the centrality of our year
old alliance clinton said on tour that will also take her to papua new
guinea australia and new zealand
it the alliance provides stability for the region and think it much
bigger than any one particular issue clinton said suggesting the alliance
trumped the problem of the base
tokyo relations with its most important ally have been strained over the
futenma base which prime minister yukio hatoyama has suggested should be moved
off the southern island of okinawa or even outside japan altogether
the center left hatoyama who took power in september has pledged to review
past agreements on the us military presence including plans to shift futenma
within okinawa and to deal with washington on more equal basis
but clinton urged patience as new party adjusts to power in japan and put
positive spin on us ties with the new government praising it for setting up
five billion dollar fund for afghanistan
so we see our relationship with japan as very broad and deep and security is
obviously critical part of that but it is by no means the only part she
said
yomiuri newspaper and other reports said sunday that clinton and okada will make
final arrangements tuesday for an anniversary statement by the us and japanese
leaders stressing the contribution of their alliance to global peace
the security treaty signed on january has formed the bedrock of the
post war japan us alliance under which pacifist japan relies on massive us
military presence to guarantee its security
during her two day stop clinton will visit the uss arizona memorial in pearl
harbor which commemorates those who died in the japanese surprise attack on
december that brought the united states into world war ii
she will then travel to papua new guinea for talks on climate change and
economic development before heading to new zealand and australia where she will
discuss similar issues as well as international security
kurt campbell the assistant secretary of state for asian affairs said clinton
will also seek advice from australian prime minister kevin rudd who speaks
chinese about how the united states can better work with china
beijing support is key for us goals in curbing the nuclear ambitions of iran
and north korea as well as combating climate change
for her first overseas trip as chief diplomat clinton visited japan indonesia
south korea and china last february she traveled to india and thailand in july
then singapore and the philippines in november
her repeated visits to asia are signal that the united states intends to be
leader and exercise influence in this region for this century as well as last
century clinton said
there was general sense on the part of our allies and partners in the region
that we were withdrawing she said suggesting the previous administration of
president george bush had neglected the region
but people want to see that the united states is fully engaged in asia so that
as china rises there is presence of the united states as force for peace
and stability as guarantor of security
clinton played down the risk of tension with china as president barack obama
administration supports the sale of defensive arms to taiwan and engages with
the dalai lama the spiritual leader of tibet
what expecting is that we actually have mature relationship that fits the
description that was given at the summit between our two presidents that it be
positive cooperative and comprehensive she said
that means that it doesn go off the rails when we have differences of
opinion
