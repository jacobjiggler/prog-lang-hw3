brighter financial markets prompt dollar selloff
new york jan afp
the dollar wobbled wednesday as brighter outlook on global financial markets
prompted selling of safe haven currencies as traders took on more risk
the euro moved up to dollars at gmt against dollars late
tuesday in new york
the dollar meanwhile rose to yen up from against the japanese unit
which is also safe haven currency
kathy lien at global forex trading said the lack of any major economic or
corporate news catalyst prompted the market to boost risk appetite
foreign exchange traders continue to pile on risky assets she said
low volatility fuels risk appetite and encourages traders to use cheap funding
currencies like the dollar and the yen to fund investments in high yielding
currencies like the euro and australian dollars
analysts said traders were cautious ahead of the european central bank policy
setting meeting thursday and press conference from governor jean claude trichet
the markets expect the ecb to maintain its record low interest rates of
percent
but the fate of greece also weighed on sentiment
greece debt and deficit crisis has rung alarm bells throughout the eurozone
where officials have been forced to ponder whether they can and should bail out
fellow member of the nation bloc
greek authorities have insisted they are capable of restoring order to the
country public finances and have no intention of dropping the euro single
currency or turning to the international monetary fund for financial help
there is no way we will leave the euro or seek recourse to the imf we do not
need to prime minister george papandreou told nationally televised news
conference wednesday
serious fiscal problems in greece and in portugal and spain as well are
expected to push interest rate issues to the background at the ecb meeting
thursday with markets awaiting trichet comments on athens in particular
there was little reaction to the federal reserve beige book report which said
the us economy is seeing broader improvement in activity even if conditions
are still sluggish
economist brian bethune at ihs global insight said this did not offer signal
of higher us interest rates anytime soon
the recovery tugboat is struggling to pick up speed but heavy anchors continue
to drag along the bottom behind he said
thus the fed is expected to continue for some time with an exceptionally
accommodative stance on monetary policy

snooker world champion higgins crashes out of masters
london jan afp
world champion john higgins crashed out of the masters here on wednesday after
one of the most error strewn performances in the scot career
higgins was beaten by northern ireland mark allen who advances to
quarter final meeting with mark selby conqueror of chinese star ding junhui
higgins was bidding for hat trick of masters titles following his previous
triumphs in and but he never looked in contention at wembley
arguably the turning point in the match came in the fourth frame which higgins
who was experiencing his ninth first round defeat in the tournament looked
set to win before he touched red with his cue as he was lining up black
the uncharacteristic lapse enabled allen to open up two frame lead at the
interval and despite string of errors the world number was able to keep
the even more erratic world number one at bay to complete win
allen admitted he had not been at his best and recognised higgins had been very
off form
it wasn very good he said missed too many balls and it was an unusual
john higgins out there today everyone has their off days it just
unexpected
higgins who is the provisional world number one was gracious in defeat
never seem to play well here he admitted can only liken it to golfer
who doesn play well on certain courses
ve lost so many first round matches but its in the manner in which ve lost
them
take nothing away from mark if you look at the points total he had about
and had around was lucky to win three frames today
