terrorist threat in yemen italian foreign minister franco frattini said in
television interview sunday
the moment is delicate he told the private canale station
in yemen there are hundreds of active al qaeda men and not only in that
country he said
the eu had to rapidly elaborate strategy of prevention and of collaboration
on terrorism he added
frattini stressed that for long time we have forgotten the terrorist risk
which unfortunately has reappeared
good place to start would be at the january conference on afghanistan in
london he said
the presence of foreign ministers will allow us also to discuss terrorism
think this will be right moment
on friday british prime minister gordon brown called an international meeting
on fighting extremism in yemen for january in london the same day as the
already scheduled conference on afghanistan
the call came after the alleged bid by nigerian national umar farouk

avatar blue yields billion dollars in box office gold
los angeles jan afp
hollywood blockbuster avatar surged to box office haul of more than one
billion dollars globally on sunday faster than any other movie in history an
industry tracker reported
aided by consecutive holiday weekends and pricey tickets total domestic
sales for the science fiction epic reached million dollars and an eye
popping million internationally according to estimated figures by exhibitor
relations
the astronomical performance since the movie debut days ago has already
sealed its reputation as one of the most impressive box office performers of all
time
it was the fastest ever to the one billion dollar mark with avatar now the
third biggest grossing film ever behind titanic and the return of the
king the final movie in the lord of the rings trilogy box office
analyst chad hartigan of exhibitor relations told afp
avatar tells the story of paralyzed war veteran jake who is sent on mission
from earth to the planet pandora where he falls in love with blue humanoid
named neytiri of the alien na vi race
its new year weekend ticket sales of million dollars easily set
domestic record for the biggest ever third weekend for film while worldwide
sales of million for avatar at imax also broke the record for the mega
screen format according to hollywood com
it was expected to do well but not this well hartigan said
optimistic estimates hovered around million domestically over its total run
but to have that already in days is ridiculous hartigan added
it holding so well from week to week at this point the sky seems to be the
limit
avatar is director james cameron first film since the oscar winner
titanic which suffered production delays and severe criticism for its bloated
budget but eventually became the highest grossing film of all time
his latest masterpiece became the most expensive film ever made at up to
million dollars
that poor guy is up against it every time hartigan said he seems to
encounter serious doubt and then delivers
the previous weekend earning million dollars from friday to sunday the
film helped boost the north american box office to the highest grossing weekend
in movie history at nearly million dollars
the figure smashed the previous best weekend mark of million set in july
when batman blockbuster the dark knight opened to huge audiences in
canada and the united states
coming in distant second for the weekend but still with respectable
million dollars was guy ritchie sherlock holmes its two week total has now
reached million dollars
in third place also in its second week was the comedy alvin and the
chipmunks the squeakquel which took million dollars for total of
million
holding firm in fourth place was it complicated love triangle comedy
starring meryl streep alec baldwin and steve martin earning million
dollars
fifth place belonged to the blind side about white couple who give an
illiterate black teen home and new lease on life with million dollars
up in the air starring george clooney in the acclaimed story of corporate
downsizer who questions his role in life held sixth place with million
dollars
disney the princess and the frog took seventh with million while eighth
place went to romantic comedy did you hear about the morgans with
million
finding itself in ninth was the appropriately named nine the broadway
musical film adaptation starring daniel day lewis as film director in mid
life crisis juggling wife marion cotillard mistress penelope cruz and
film star muse nicole kidman it scored million dollars
rounding out the top with million was invictus about how south
african president nelson mandela united the country around the rugby world

manchester united won thanks to jermaine beckford th minute goal and will
now face tottenham in the fourth round

defeat was the first time manchester united manager sir alex ferguson had lost
in the third round since he arrived at old trafford years ago and marked
united first exit at this stage since losing to bournemouth in
the preparation for the game was very good but shocked by the
performance said ferguson
we didn start right and leeds did start right they fought like tigers and
we expect that with any team coming to old trafford for an fa cup tie it
disappointment
this loss was not what united wanted ahead of wednesday league cup semi final

to get this result out of our system as quickly as possible

strike and four minutes later year old striker sturridge had his second and
chelsea fifth goal
chelsea manager carlo ancelotti was particularly pleased by the performance of
sturridge
the young forward goals were his first for the blues since pre season move
from manchester city and were timely as chelsea are currently without in form
striker didier drogba because of the ivory coast international african nations
cup commitments
it was good performance and sturridge played very well said ancelotti
without drogba it is important to have him in good condition

first half against committed west ham
in the second half we played at higher tempo west ham dropped bit
physically and we could make the difference in the final minutes
west ham manager gianfranco zola added we were very close am pleased with

rugbyu wasps boss joins venter in railing at refs
london jan afp
wasps coach tony hanks added his voice to the criticism of refereeing standards
in the english premiership after his side lost at home to newcastle on
sunday
saracens chief brendan venter slammed officials on saturday for killing top
level club rugby in england as an entertaining spectacle
the south african now faces the prospect of disciplinary action after the rugby
football union announced on sunday they would be holding an inquiry to see if
venter had case to answer for bringing the game into disrepute
but he received measure of support from hanks after an adams park match where
all the points came from penalty goals newcastle jimmy gopperth landing four
to one apiece from wasps dave walder and mark van gisbergen as the victorious
visitors moved up into sixth in the table
both teams tried to play some rugby and that where most frustrated said
hanks
week in week out the breakdown seems to be different we need to get clear
interpretation in terms of who allowed to play the ball
we need that to encourage teams to play rugby at the moment what incentive is
there to play rugby
we have to deal with what we ve been dealt with in terms of the law but the
contest at the breakdown is not even
the new zealander added my big thing is the tackler when he allowed to
play the ball again has he released it in the tackler favour at the
moment
newcastle counterpart steve bates sympathised with referees but said the
breakdown had to be clarified
the referee has very difficult job but we re not seeing as much consistency
as we all like bates said
there needs to be move to get the tackler out of the way very quickly and if
they don then get them off the field
venter was left fuming after premiership leaders saracens loss away to
leicester on saturday
there is problem and that is the game is determined by referees and not by
teams said the former springbok
everybody wants to know why the game is dying maybe that is why the game is
dying
