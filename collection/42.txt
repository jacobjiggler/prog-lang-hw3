abbas visits egypt for talks on mideast peace
cairo jan afp
palestinian president mahmud abbas arrived in egypt on sunday for talks aimed at
relaunching peace talks with israel amid lingering divisions over jewish
settlement expansion
abbas met with egypt intelligence chief omar suleiman after jetting in to the
red sea resort of sharm el sheikh where he is hold talks with egyptian
president hosni mubarak on monday before heading to qatar kuwait and turkey
president abbas will present to president mubarak the important developments
that confront the palestinian cause and the great challenges facing the entire
region abbas spokesman nabil abu rudeina said
the visit comes almost week after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
met in cairo with mubarak about the stalled peace process and as diplomats said
washington was drafting letters of guarantees for the peace talks
an arab diplomat told afp last week that us special envoy george mitchell would
present the letters to israel and the palestinian authority on his next visit to
the region
the united states is hoping that the two letters will serve as basis for the
relaunch of israeli palestinian negotiations but we don know if they will
satisfy the palestinians who want complete freeze of settlement activity
before talks resume the diplomat said
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit is also planning to visit washington
for talks with officials on january and has said he will be accompanied by
cairo intelligence chief omar suleiman
us president barack obama has repeatedly called on the two sides to resume peace
talks but the palestinians have demanded israel first freeze all settlement
activity and commit to framework for the talks
egypt saudi arabia and turkey have all urged israel to halt its settlement
activity while saudi foreign minister prince saud al faisal hit out at the
jewish state on saturday for acting like spoiled child
abbas spokesman abu rudeina said there are arab and international efforts to
create the climate to support the return to negotiations with the israeli side
based on complete halt to settlements
he added the palestinians would also require specific guidelines for the
talks including that the borders of future palestinian state encompass all of
their land israel occupied in
the palestinians have insisted that mostly arab east jerusalem occupied by
israel in and later annexed in move not recognised by the international
community be the capital of their future state
the israeli position that we have seen up until now is not encouraging and it
will not be possible to return to the negotiations based on it abu rudeina
said
netanyahu in november imposed month halt on new construction of settlements
in the occupied west bank but excluded east jerusalem public buildings and
housing units already under construction
abbas suspended peace talks with israel after it entered day war with
hamas the islamist rulers of gaza that killed more than palestinians and
left swathes of gaza devastated thirteen israelis were killed
hamas takeover of gaza in which shrank abbas powerbase to the west
bank left deep rift between palestinians that have also hampered peace talks
with israel
egypt has already twice postponed the planned signing of reconciliation
agreement in cairo because of deep divisions between hamas and abbas fatah
supporters
but exiled hamas leader khaled meshaal said during visit sunday to saudi
arabia that reconciliation deal is close

no smoking gun tagged plane bomb suspect us official
washington jan afp
there was no smoking gun that could have led us intelligence agencies to
thwart an attack by an al qaeda linked nigerian aboard us bound airliner
top white house security adviser said sunday
us president barack obama counter terrorism adviser john brennan said there
were several bits and pieces of intelligence gathered in the run up to the
botched christmas day bombing and that human or systemic failure lay in not
putting together those pieces of larger puzzle
there was no smoking gun there was no piece of intelligence that said this guy
is terrorist and is going to get on plane none whatsoever brennan told
fox news sunday as part of round of talk show interviews
it was failure to integrate the bits and pieces of information
the terror scare prompted obama to order review of intelligence and security
operations to find any breakdowns that allowed abdulmutallab to get on the
plane
brennan statements came shortly after the united states and britain agreed to
finance special counterterrorism unit in yemen as obama for the first time
saturday blamed an al qaeda branch in that arab country for plotting the attack
and training the suspect in how to carry it out
on sunday the two countries closed their embassies in sanaa over security fears
brennan said washington closed its embassy because there are indications that
al qaeda is planning to carry out an attack against target inside of sanaa
possibly our embassy
obama on saturday accused al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap yemen
based cell of osama bin laden group of targeting northwest jet carrying
people as it approached detroit
but brennan indicated that the united states was not opening new front against
al qaeda in yemen and has no plans to send troops there
wouldn say we re opening second front this is continuation of an
effort that we had underway as said since the beginning of the obama
administration said brennan
obama promised to hold aqap to account and said us probes were revealing new
evidence about the suspected bomber umar farouk abdulmutallab of nigeria
we know that he traveled to yemen obama said in his weekly video address
it appears that he joined an affiliate of al qaeda and that the group
trained him equipped him with those explosives and directed him to attack that
plane headed for america
adulmutallab is suspected of trying to destroy the jet by setting off explosives
stitched into his underwear the detonator failed to set off the explosives
instead lighting fire which was put out by passengers and crew
brennan also accused radical yemeni cleric anwar al awlaqi of trying to
instigate terrorism due to his alleged links to both the christmas plane bomb
plot and the shooting that killed people at us military base in november
think what we are clear about is that mr awlaqi was in touch with alleged
fort hood shooter major nidal hasan and there are indications that he had
contact direct contact with abdulmutallab brennan said on cnn
mr awlaqi is problem he clearly part of al qaeda in the arabian
peninsula he not just cleric he is in fact trying to instigate terrorism
obama was expected back in washington monday after family vacation in hawaii
on the eve of key meeting on the attack with chiefs of us spy agencies and
government departments with national security responsibilities
general david petraeus the us regional commander met yemeni president ali
abdullah saleh on saturday but few details were made public of the talks which
coincided with reports of american involvement in strikes against extremists
there
michael leiter director of the us national counterterrorism center nctc
warned on saturday the christmas day attack would not be the last
while this attempt ended in failure we know with absolute certainty that al
qaeda and those who support its ideology continue to refine their methods to
test our defenses and pursue an attack on the homeland he said
the nctc was set up after the september attacks in exposed disastrous
lack of intelligence sharing among us spy services but has been one of several
agencies criticized over the northwest airlines attack

trafford on sunday
leeds the league one leaders who are places below english champions
manchester united won thanks to jermaine beckford th minute goal and will
now face tottenham in the fourth round

eduardo stunned the upton park faithful as arsenal won to set up another all
premier league cup clash against stoke
fa cup holders chelsea who lead the premier league by two points from
manchester united cruised through with thrashing of second division
watford at stamford bridge and will now be away to another championship team
preston north end
defeat was the first time manchester united manager sir alex ferguson had lost
in the third round since he arrived at old trafford years ago and marked
united first exit at this stage since losing to bournemouth in
leeds goal came after jonny howson superb yard pass over the head of wes
brown found striker beckford who outpaced the defender before sliding the ball
left footed into the far corner and beyond goalkeeper tomasz kuszczak
the preparation for the game was very good but shocked by the
performance said ferguson
we didn start right and leeds did start right they fought like tigers and
we expect that with any team coming to old trafford for an fa cup tie it
disappointment
this loss was not what united wanted ahead of wednesday league cup semi final
first leg tie against local rivals manchester city and ferguson said we have
to get this result out of our system as quickly as possible
leeds manager simon grayson hailed his outstanding side after they produced
one of the great fa cup shocks
full credit to the players who were outstanding today but it what they ve
been like all season he said
chelsea were in front by the nd minute thanks to daniel sturridge john
eustace own goal and florent malouda deflected shot
england midfielder frank lampard made it in the th minute with yard
strike and four minutes later year old striker sturridge had his second and
chelsea fifth goal
chelsea manager carlo ancelotti was particularly pleased by the performance of
sturridge
the young forward goals were his first for the blues since pre season move
from manchester city and were timely as chelsea are currently without in form
striker didier drogba because of the ivory coast international african nations
cup commitments
it was good performance and sturridge played very well said ancelotti
without drogba it is important to have him in good condition
meanwhile relieved arsenal manager arsene wenger said we had very difficult
first half against committed west ham
in the second half we played at higher tempo west ham dropped bit
physically and we could make the difference in the final minutes
west ham manager gianfranco zola added we were very close am pleased with
the performance of the team couldn ask for anything more
