us drone attack kills five in pakistan officials
peshawar pakistan jan afp
us missiles flattened an extremist hideout in pakistan lawless tribal belt
sunday killing five militants in the latest strike in recent spike in drone
attacks pakistani officials said
the attack targeted house in mosakki village about kilometres miles
east of miranshah the main town in north waziristan and was the third
suspected us missile attack in the tribal district in less than week
there may have been an important figure hiding in the house pakistani
security official in miranshah told afp on condition of anonymity because he was
not authorised to speak about the sensitive strikes
total of five militants have been killed two are local and three are
foreigners one among the foreigners is an arab the security official said
adding that the identity of the other two was not yet known
suspected us drones have increasingly targeted north waziristan bastion of
al qaeda fighters and the haqqani network that attacks us and nato troops
fighting against the taliban in neighbouring afghanistan
washington is putting increased pressure on pakistan to tackle militants who use
its soil to launch attacks in afghanistan and american officials have said that
the highly secretive drone programme has eliminated some top fighters
one us drone fired two missiles on house the target was this house and
car parked outside was also destroyed senior pakistani security official
earlier told afp on condition of anonymity
local administrative and intelligence officials confirmed the attack and the
death toll
north waziristan borders the afghan province of khost where suicide bomber
killed seven cia agents and an eighth american on us base last week in the
deadliest attack on the us spy agency since
washington has put pakistan at the heart of new strategy for winning the
eight year war against the taliban in afghanistan saying success depends on
dismantling militant sanctuaries along the porous border
around eight us missile strikes in north waziristan have killed people in the
past month although the identities of those killed are hard to verify as the
deaths are deep in taliban controlled territory
the attacks on pakistani territory fuel anti american sentiment in the nuclear
armed muslim nation and the government in islamabad publicly condemns the
strikes analysts say however that the strikes have islamabad tacit
approval
more than us drone missile strikes have killed at least people in
pakistan since august the united states does not confirm drone attacks
but its military is the only force that deploys drones in the region
north waziristan neighbours south waziristan where pakistan has been focusing
its most ambitious military offensive yet against homegrown taliban militants
it sent about troops into the region on october

rugbyu castres roll on as stade stutter
paris jan afp
castres consolidated their lead of the french top with six try drubbing of
albi on sunday as stade francais stuttered to drab all draw with montauban
second placed racing metro who last lost in september were denied th
successive win by doughty bourgoin who triumphed in the french capital
racing saw late penalty from springbok centre francois steyn and last gasp
jonathan wisniewski drop goal both drift wide and pierre berbizier team had to
be content with defensive bonus point
clermont with game in hand on the top two kept up the pressure on the
leaders with an impressive five try dismantling of toulon for whom england
outside half johnny wilkinson was replaced at half time after complaining of
back pains
outplayed up front toulon conceded tries to canadian lock jamie cudmore
outstanding scrum half morgan parra winger julien malzieu and late replacement
kevin senio as well as penalty try
we built up good game and ended up dominating said clermont captain aurelie
rougerie we ll keep on working it long season ahead
fifth placed perpignan suffered shock defeat to brive for whom england
centre rikki flutey made his comeback from injury and france international full
back alexis palisson was key scoring try conversion and five penalties
for personal haul of points
georgian prop davit kinchagishvili scored the opening try for the hosts while
the visitors abrasive romanian prop marius tincu was in the sin bin
south african replacement centre ronnie cooke rounded off brive comprehensive
win with try seven minutes from time with perpignan only managing three
penalties from ex natal sharks outside half steve meyer
we showed lot of heart today said palisson we wanted to rebound from the
defeat at clermont
we gave everything and think perpignan had hand in our success they let
us play the ball which gave us the chance of snatching the attacking bonus
point

the style in their demolition of bottom placed albi
the home side scored through marc andreu cameron mcintyre double former all
black chris masoe iosefa tekori and penalty try as albi crumbled after
sebastien pages was sent off in the th minute for violent play
we re very happy said castres lock matthias rolland we came out of
potential banana skin of match very well three days after the montauban
match we knew we had to stay focused
it win for man squad in which everyone has part to play
but struggling stade francais desperate for victory to help ensure
participation in next season european cup could only manage to slug out
dour draw with montauban on heavy pitch
two lionel beauxis penalties cancelled out penalty and drop goal by cedric
rosalen in what turned out to be forward slug fest with neither side gaining
the ascendancy
mid table biarritz sealed much needed win over montpellier scoring four tries
to one in victory

france joins europe flu vaccine sell off
paris jan afp
france has joined other european countries in selling off millions of its
emergency swine flu vaccines the government announcing sunday it had bought far
more than needed to fight the outbreak
we started with plan for two dose vaccinations but since one dose is
sufficient we can start to re sell part of the stock french health ministry
official told afp
like germany the netherlands and some other european countries france has
witnessed less demand than expected after spending million euros
billion dollars on vaccines for the virus
france bought million doses almost one and half for every member of the
population but so far only about five million people are recorded as having
been vaccinated since the programme was launched in october
the government took the decision to sell some of its stock after european
medical authorities said one off vaccination was enough to protect against the
virus
the health ministry said qatar had already bought doses and egypt was
negotiating to buy two million france was also in discussions with mexico and
ukraine it added
in december germany said it was looking to sell off vaccines even though its
full order of million doses was not due to be delivered until march only
about five percent of the population had been vaccinated there
germany reported requests for vaccines from afghanistan and central european
countries including ukraine which is also now negotiating with france
the netherlands announced in november that it would sell million of the
million vaccines it ordered to countries with shortage of them judging that
the danger had passed
spain health minister trinidad jimenez told sunday el pais newspaper that
madrid expected to buy total of about million doses little more than
third of its earlier estimate of million
the world health organisation who said last month that the virus was
peaking in much of western europe as the disease progressed into central europe
and through parts of asia
german authorities said moldova kosovo mongolia and the maldives had
approached them asking for vaccines to be donated as aid
in britain health ministry spokesman told afp sunday their priority was still
to supply high risk groups such as the very young the elderly pregnant women
and people with underlying health problems
but he added we are also considering sale to countries still seeking vaccine
the latest british figures for the outbreak issued on thursday indicated that
the rate of swine flu infection was falling but opinion polls suggested that in
any case many people were reluctant to take the vaccine
in italy the health ministry head of preventive medicine fabrizio oleari told
the ansa agency no decision had yet been made on whether to sell excess stock
but italy had already undertaken to give percent of its stock to poorer
countries he added so far only of the million doses bought have
been administered
the who said last week that swine flu had killed at least people
worldwide with the biggest share of victims in the united states and canada
though it was now declining in north america
in france the opposition socialists health spokesman jean marie le guen called
the government strategy fiasco saying in statement that despite its
exaggerated spending france still had very low rate of vaccination
disease specialist marc gentilini former president of the french red cross
also criticised what he called france extravagant and costly mass
vaccination campaign
preparing for the worst wasn necessarily preparing correctly he told afp

egypt court upholds niqab ban
cairo jan afp
an egyptian court on sunday upheld ruling by the education ministry to ban
women from wearing the full face veil in university examination halls judicial
sources said
the ministry took the decision in october to ban the niqab veil covering the
entire face usually worn by devout muslims for security reasons
the administrative court decision which may be appealed came after more than
students filed petition against the ban
the row over the niqab has intensified in recent months after mohammed sayyed
tantawi grand imam of al azhar sunni islam main seat of learning banned the
niqab in all residences and schools affiliated to al azhar
the only exception made is in classrooms where the teacher is male
the ministry of health has tried to ban it among nurses and the ministry of
religious endowments distributed booklets saying the practice of wearing the
niqab has no basis in islam
most muslim women in egypt cover their hair but the full face veil is
associated with the ultra conservative salafi school of thought which is based
mostly in saudi arabia and is gaining popularity in the country
salafism has inspired such militants as al qaeda chief osama bin laden and his
egyptian deputy ayman al zawahiri most of its practitioners however shun
politics
the niqab trend has worried al azhar whose theology salafis generally view with
contempt

football honours even in old firm edinburgh derbies
glasgow jan afp
rangers retained their seven point advantage at the top of the scottish premier
league over celtic as two late goals meant the old firm derby ended at
parkhead here on sunday
super sub scott mcdonald looked to have sealed well deserved win for celtic
when the australian international headed past allan mcgregor with minutes
left
but lee mcculloch nodded in the equaliser two minutes later with his side
first shot on target before mcgregor produced superb save to deny georgios
samaras late winner
am delighted to get point but overall we were little bit fortunate
admitted rangers manager walter smith
we didn play the way we have done in recent weeks and celtic imposed
themselves on the match
celtic boss tony mowbray said he was disappointed his side had not won
think we did enough to win and the performance of the team possibly warranted
the three points said mowbray
the players will take great confidence from this game as they did from the
first match at ibrox
celtic will rue host of missed chances including first half marc antoine
fortune goal which was controversially ruled out for foul on mcgregor as
celtic dominated the league leaders who looked pale shadow of the side which
had previously won six successive matches
smith was forced to make two changes to the side that put seven past dundee
united with danny wilson replacing madjid bougherra and steven whittaker in for
the suspended kenny miller
rangers game plan was further disrupted when nacho novo was injured in an early
collision with samaras and limped off in the th minute and was replaced by
maurice edu
aiden mcgeady was causing all sorts of problems for rangers down the left wing
as the ibrox side who had scored times in their previous six games
struggled to get out of their own half
celtic thought they had made the breakthrough in the th minute when they had
the ball in the net
mcgeady miss hit shot looked to be covered by mcgregor but fortune leapt above
him to head the ball into the net
however the home side were incensed when referee steve conroy controversially
ruled it out for foul after the striker appeared to make slight contact with
the keeper
kyle lafferty was lucky to stay on the pitch when he was booked on the half hour
mark for high and late challenge on andreas hinkel
danny fox curling free kick went straight to mcgregor before barry robson rose
unmarked in the box to meet hinkel cross from the right and slam header off
the bar
five minutes from the break mcgeady headed another hinkel cross just wide before
samaras missed golden chance to put celtic ahead as rangers somehow ended the
half on level terms
mcdonald came on for marc crosas and the australian made an immediate impact
when he gave celtic the lead in the th minute
mcgeady sent over cross from the right and the socceroos striker nodded past
mcgregor from couple of yards out
the lead was short lived and incredibly rangers equalised with their first shot
on target
mcculloch got in front of gary caldwell to meet steven davis corner and send
downward header bouncing over artur boruc
meanwhile sunday edinburgh derby between hibernian and hearts also ended in
draw after both sides had player sent off
eighteen year old gordon smith scored for hearts on his league debut but anthony
stokes equalised for the hosts nine minutes after half time
shortly afterwards came red cards for hearts ruben palazuelos and darren
mccormack of hibs after the latter appeared to headbutt the spaniard

mexico arrests brother of slain druglord
mexico city jan afp
police have detained the brother of slain druglord arturo beltran leyva who was
mexico third most wanted man as president felipe calderon presses his war on
drug violence officials said
security officials said carlos beltran leyva was arrested in culiacan sinaloa
on december according to statement released late saturday
he was said to be key cartel leader in the crime ridden region of northern
mexico which has seen spike in violence and drug related killings
the mexican government has deployed thousands of federal police and
soldiers to battle the cartels whose feuds have resulted in some deaths
countrywide since
arturo beltran leyva accused of smuggling tons of cocaine and heroin and
billions of dollars of cash through the united states was mexico third most
wanted man with million dollar million euro reward on offer for
information leading to his capture
the cartel chief was killed in shootout with security forces on december
air france pilots warn of risky speed probes report
paris jan afp
air france pilots have criticised investigators of the carrier fatal jet crash
in june and warned planes should avoid icy weather until tests prove whether
their speed sensors can withstand it report said sunday
the weekly journal du dimanche cited extracts from report to be submitted to
judicial officials this week by two pilots one the head of the pilots union
spaf on the crash of flight af from rio to paris that killed people
in report last month the french air accident investigation agency bea said
the jet pitot speed probes gave false readings before it crashed into the
atlantic and called for better testing standards for such probes
until these are developed however planes are still flying in weather
conditions for which the speed sensors are not certified which runs contrary
to the safety requirements under current regulations the pilots report said
according to the newspaper
pilots unions and some of the relatives of victims of june crash have accused
air france and plane maker airbus of ignoring longstanding problems with air
speed monitors on its jets in the run up to the june disaster
the companies insist that their jets met all safety standards but they have
nevertheless replaced pitots made by the french electronics company thales with
different model produced by us firm goodrich
the report by the pilots henri marnet cornus and spaf president gerard arnoux
said this would lower the level of risk but further faults were possible
since the probes had not been tested for the effects of ice crystals
the pilots had argued in an earlier report that the freezing of the pitots had
caused the airbus to crash the bea has said they were one of the factors
in the crash but not the sole cause
the pilots also criticised what they called the short sighted approach of the
bea concerning the faultiness of the pitot probes according to the newspaper
they said planes should be banned for the moment from flying into patches of icy
weather that could cause the speed probes to freeze up and probes should be
certified for all weather conditions and all types of plane
when pitots are blocked by ice they send false speed measurements to the plane
onboard flight computers as was the case on the missing flight in june it sent
string of automated error messages before plunging into the ocean
football sturridge at the double as chelsea wallop watford
london jan afp
daniel sturridge double the forward first goals for chelsea helped the
fa cup holders secure comfortable victory over watford to claim place in
the fourth round here at stamford bridge on sunday
sturridge efforts were backed up by goals from florent malouda frank lampard
and an own goal from john eustace as chelsea ensured they avoided the fate of
premier league title rivals manchester united beaten by leeds earlier on
sunday of bowing out of the fa cup against lower league opposition
and while blues boss carlo ancelotti will be cautious not to draw too much from
routine win over championship club he will be satisfied that chelsea won in
their first game since didier drogba john obi mikel michael essien and salomon
kalou all departed for the african cup of nations
in particular the chelsea coach could be pleased with the display of year old
striker sturridge deputising for the absent drogba and kalou as well as the
injured nicolas anelka
right from the opening whistle it was clear this was an unfair contest with
second tier watford immediately reduced to the role of spectators as chelsea in
italian manager ancelotti first fa cup tie carved them open with swift
passing moves
chelsea raced into three goal lead with just minutes on the clock
following series of ricochets and deflections that only served to underline
the weakness of the visitors defence
the opening goal came after lampard directed corner towards the far post where
centre back alex rose unimpeded to head the ball down
the brazilian actually miscued his header into the path of central defensive
partner john terry and the england skipper snapshot was turned in by sturridge
for the youngster first goal since his pre season move from manchester city
with the home side clearly in ruthless form the last thing watford needed to do
was gift their hosts second goal but that was exactly what they did in the
th minute
it was bad enough that joe cole was allowed to meet malouda deep cross at the
far post
but when the england international header came back off the inside of the post
watford should have done better than allow the ball to bounce off lampard back
and into the net via deflection off eustace
worse was to come for watford seven minutes later when yuri zhirkov shot was
diverted past keeper scott loach off malouda heel
reading had demonstrated how championship side can unsettle premier league
opponents by holding liverpool to fa cup draw at the madejski stadium on
saturday
but where reading managed to make life uncomfortable for rafa benitez side
watford simply couldn get near to ancelotti players
to their credit malky mackay team did manage to reach the interval without
suffering any more damage and they even managed to create half chance
themselves that was fluffed by forward danny graham
then after the break and with chelsea giving the impression of having completed
their afternoon work watford skipper jay demerit even forced home keeper
hilario into action
chelsea though weren finished and lampard produced the goal of the game in
the th minute when he sent dipping shot from the edge of the watford area
arrowing into the top corner of loach goal
and sturridge claimed his second four minutes later with composed close range
finish from ashley cole cross

negotiations have so far led nowhere russian officials said sunday amid
concerns that supplies to europe may be affected

for the russian energy ministry told afp
russia and belarus failed on new year eve to agree new terms for oil supplies

russian officials pledged the current talks would not affect oil supplies to the

belarus wants to receive russian crude duty free russian officials say they
want to receive it for free process it and then send it abroad said an
official with transneft

to belarussian refineries from january raising the spectre of repeat of
energy crisis that led to cut in russian oil supplies to the european
union for several days
putin spokesman dmitry peskov indicated that if supply interruptions were to
take place it would not be russia fault
there is supply and it is percent guaranteed peskov told afp
spokesman for the belarussian government alexander timoshenko said he was
unaware of any possible cuts in russian oil supplies to belarus and
spokesperson for the country oil processor belneftekhim declined comment
together with kazakhstan russia and belarus have sought to create single

efforts by minsk to resuscitate relations with the west
