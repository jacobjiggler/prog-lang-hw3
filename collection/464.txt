sunday playoff showdowns
only green bay nfl champions reached the super bowl after losing their
last two regular season games as indianapolis did following start
colts coach jim caldwell chose to rest key players to avoid injuries
you re going to see totally different team colts center jeff saturday said
you move on and get better as team that what we chose to do and hoping
it works out this is how you set legacy playing well in big games
no team ever reached super bowl after losing its last three regular season
games as the saints did after winning their first
would we have liked to have played better definitely saints quarterback drew
brees said but don think there are any real concerns we know the level we
are capable of playing at
all host teams are coming off first round byes raising an issue of whether or
not the extra rest will help or harm the bid to regain momentum the colts
seeking second nfl crown in four years are after playoff byes
really don have an answer why colts quarterback peyton manning said
this team has its own identity hopefully we can play good enough to win
that all we re thinking about
the colts who beat the ravens in november rested manning and other key
players after clinching home field playoff edge while the ravens battled into
the final day just to reach the playoffs then routed new england
ravens top rusher ray rice faces run defense ranked th of teams but it
will be baltimore defensive unit powered by ray lewis trying to shut down
manning that will likely decide the outcome
every possession against the ravens feels like grind manning said every
time you get first down or are fortunate to get touchdown you feel like
you ve done something really good
high scoring affair is expected in new orleans with brees powering saints
attack that led the nfl with points and arizona coming off overtime
win over green bay in the highest scoring playoff game in nfl history
three of the last four years we have had the top offense in the league we know
how to play at high level offensively said brees
but arizona kurt warner and corps of speedy receivers are looking for
return to the super bowl where the cardinals lost last year to pittsburgh in
the final seconds
we ve been there before warner said think the key for us still is to
try to stay loose even though the expectations are different that what
think was little easier for us last year
not since have both top seeds reached the super bowl so beware the
chargers who ended the season with triumphs in row but face the nfl top
rushing attack and best defense in jets team that has won six of its past
seven
we re at our best right now and the chargers are at their best jets coach rex
ryan said it makes for great matchup
the jets pass defense will be tested by philip rivers and set of tall san
diego receivers but new york players are already thinking super bowl
the super bowl on most teams is that elephant in the room that no one can talk
about everybody knows it there we are not afraid to talk about it jets
safety jim leonhard said
the vikings at home this season are two wins from reaching the super bowl
the dream year old brett favre had when he made second return from
retirement to play for minnesota which hasn reached super bowl since
didn know who we would play but saw us in this moment and getting ready
to play this game favre said
now envision us winning and going on if that doesn happen to me it will
be shock
favre threw touchdowns and only two interceptions in the metrodome this
season
obama vows us help for haiti aid operation builds
washington jan afp
president barack obama promised haitians thursday they would not be forgotten
offering million dollars in immediate earthquake aid and the backing of
every element of us power
large scale us military and civilian aid operation gained momentum with
washington sending rescue teams ships helicopters planes floating
hospital emergency supplies and more than ground troops
to the people of haiti we say clearly and with conviction you will not be
forsaken you will not be forgotten obama said
the president offered every element of our national capacity our diplomacy and
development assistance the power of our military and most importantly the
compassion of our country following the disaster
as rescuers raced to find survivors among thousands of corpses in haiti obama
recalled two top deputies from foreign trips
defense secretary robert gates cancelled weekend visit to australia and
secretary of state hillary clinton returned to washington early thursday to help
coordinate us efforts after haiti worst earthquake in more than century
search and rescue teams from florida virginia and california were on the ground
thursday in port au prince as was group of us air force experts working to
restore air traffic control at the airport vital hub for international aid
the leading role for the humanitarian effort fell to the united states haiti
wealthy neighbor which has deployed troops and aid in the past to the
impoverished caribbean nation amid refugee crises and political unrest
the extent of the planning that has to go into this to make sure we do the
maximum good possible is something that the united states is taking the lead
in clinton said while also praising the relief efforts of several other
nations
washington was providing lot of the glue that is keeping people communicating
and working together as we try to assert authority reinstate the government and
begin to do what governments have to do to rebuild and reconstruct this damaged
country clinton told fox news
the us army ordered brigade of troops from the nd airborne division to
haiti to ensure safe environment for relief efforts said pentagon spokesman
bryan whitman with the first soldiers to arrive later thursday
the navy deployed three large amphibious ships with marines on board and
an aircraft carrier the uss carl vinson was expected to reach haiti by friday
navy officers said the aircraft carrier will serve as floating airport for
fleet of helicopters ferrying emergency teams and aid to haiti
two other warships and several coast guard cutters with helicopters were also
bound for haiti while large hospital ship the usns comfort was being loaded
with medical supplies at its port in baltimore and due to arrive next week
the pentagon rejected criticism that it may have acted too slowly to deploy its
military might in the first hours of the disaster saying it moved in
assessment teams quickly and identified what resources were needed
the relief effort faced serious challenges obama said with roads in haiti
impassable communications rudimentary and aftershocks still rattling the
country
the country damaged airport was stretched to the limit and haiti asked the
united states and other countries not to authorize any more flights to port au
prince for now us officials said
part of the us effort was aimed at helping many of the americans clinton
said were in haiti some of whom were injured in the disaster
over us citizens were evacuated out of haiti thursday and more were to
be rescued later in the day the state department said
clinton who cut short her trip to asia and flew back from hawaii warned of
horrific death toll
we know it going to be in the tens of thousands she told msnbc
us officials were acutely aware of the need to try to stem any mass panic or
attempts to flee haiti by sea to reach the united states
over the years hundreds have made the perilous kilometer mile
journey in leaky boats and many have perished on the way

football algeria first world cup team to win in angola
luanda jan afp
algeria became the first world cup qualifiers to win at the africa cup of
nations thursday while hosts angola also took maximum points
nigeria lost to defending champions egypt cameroon were shocked by gabon and
ivory coast could only draw with burkina faso as south africa bound teams found
the going tough this week
victory for algeria over mali in the first half of luanda double header
was followed by success for angola against malawi to set up an intriguing
group climax next monday
all four countries can still finish among the top two on the final mini league
standings and reach the quarter finals in the biennial african football
showpiece
angola host algeria at the seat november stadium in the angolan
capital while malawi and mali fly north to the restive enclave of cabinda where
the togo squad was ambushed last friday for chiazi stadium showdown
the host nation finished the second series of group matches on top with four
points malawi plus one goal difference and algeria minus two have three
points each and mali one
this win has given the perfect answer to all our critics we played like team
today and got the result we wanted said veteran algeria coach rabah saadane as
his team recovered from three goal drubbing by malawi
it takes long time to build team of excellent players and did not put any
pressure on them today just told them to go out enjoy themselves and defeat
mali
we started off this match on the wrong foot but managed to increase our
confidence and the goal came at the perfect time said the coach who will guide
algeria at third world cup in south africa this june
algeria will be in the same group as england the united states and slovenia and
few outside the north african country give the desert foxes chance of making
the second round
portugal based defender rafik halliche starred against mali nodding in free
kick two minutes before half time for the lone goal of match that never caught
fire
early second half goals from flavio amado and mateus manucho alberto brought
victory to angola before capacity crowd that included president jose
eduardo dos santos
diminutive flavio once more demonstrated his remarkable heading prowess by
steering in djalma campos cross on minutes while slapstick malawi defending
gifted the second goal to manucho soon after
this time the palancas negras black antelopes defence stood firm to ensure no
repeat of the remarkable collapse last sunday when they surrendered four goal
lead against mali after minutes and had to settle for draw
malawi lowest ranked of the title contenders stroked the ball about
impressively in the first half and created few half chances but were starved
of possession after the break

premier league ipl franchise the chennai super kings after undergoing another
operation on his right knee

county side lancashire in all competitions in the next english season having
believed he would be fit for one day matches only even if he won be returning
until midway through the domestic campaign
pace bowler and hard hitting batsman flintoff retired from test cricket after
helping england regain the ashes last year saying his injury hit body could no
longer stand the strain but stressed he wanted to remain involved in the one
day set up
however he has not played at all since undergoing micro fracture operation on
his right knee soon after the ashes
but following what statement released thursday by his agent said was
routine arthroscopy operation this week to check on his knee which is
expected to sideline him for six months flintoff altered his ambitions
my goals have changed since last summer flintoff said trust the surgeon
andy williams implicitly and he is very pleased with the progress of the
operation
when first had the operation did not think would be able to play anything
other than one day cricket but the news of my recovery has led me to believe
may play in all forms of cricket for lancashire
my first love remains playing for lancashire and want to help them win
trophies and hopefully can help achieve that later this english summer
the statement added flintoff decision to undergo another operation took into
account he would not be able to fulfil the second year of his contract with
chennai in the ipl
it is disappointing not to be able to play for chennai who have been very
supportive throughout my time with them but took this decision because love
playing cricket and want to give myself the best chance of extending my career
flintoff said
he added have worked extremely hard over the last few months to get to this
position and realise there is lot more hard work in front of me if want to
return and play international cricket again
but if am going to go through another six months of hard rehabilitation and
training for long hours need big incentive to be the driving force of that
and playing for lancashire and england again will become that
flintoff said watching england tour of south africa where the concluding
fourth test in johannesburg is currently taking place had whetted his appetite
for cricket
during my time in rehabilitation have been watching england playing well in
south africa and it has made me realise how much have missed cricket the
year old explained
flintoff career has also been blighted by four ankle operations but when fit
he remains capable of high class bowling spells as was shown when he took five
wickets for runs in july to help england win test against australia at
lord for the first time in years
in tests flintoff scored runs at an average of with five
hundreds and best of he took wickets at three times taking
five wickets in an innings
flintoff has also scored nearly runs in one day internationals with
three hundreds and taken wickets

regional leaders conclude summit on zimbabwe madagascar
maputo jan afp
key southern african leaders wound up special summit in the mozambican capital
maputo on thursday with calls for return to dialogue in the ongoing political
crisis in madagascar
the security body of the nation southern african development community sadc
condemned the lack of progress in implementing power sharing deal in
madagascar even as its members praised the leaders efforts to revive
stumbling unity government in zimbabwe
following closed door meeting that included the presidents of the democratic
republic of congo mozambique namibia south africa and zambia sadc executive
secretary tomaz salomao read statement from the leaders urging madagascar
andry rajoelina to return to the negotiating table with ousted president marc
ravalomanana and two other former presidents
the summit urges all malagasy political parties to return immediately to
dialogue and show the necessary political will leadership flexibility
humility and balance to make concessions and reach compromise towards the
restoration of constitutional normalcy in madagascar the statement said
the leaders also condemned an attempt by rajoelina who seized power in march
with military backing to call parliamentary elections for march this year
effectively sidelining an august power sharing deal with his rivals
the summit rejects any attempt to use democratic means institutions and
processes to legitimize governments that came to power through unconstitutional
means said the statement
the summit also rejects the unilateral plan of the de facto government of
madagascar to reorganize the transition and hold legislative elections in
march and urges the international community to also reject it it added
on zimbabwe the leaders sounded note of praise for efforts by south african
president jacob zuma the sadc facilitator for zimbabwe to revive the flagging
unity government of longtime president robert mugabe and prime minister morgan
tsvangirai
what the summit has concluded is that the situation has moved forward in very
positive way in zimbabwe said drc president and sadc chair joseph kabila
salomao acknowledged there were unsettled issues still dividing mugabe and
tsvangirai including the controversial post of attorney general
but said salomao they don need to wait until they conclude all of them
they need to implement what they have agreed so far that was the decision that
was taken by sadc
sadc had been due to review progress in zimbabwe unity government since
special summit in november broke deadlock that threatened to sink the deal
south african mediators had since held talks in harare among the rival zimbabwe
parties to settle the differences threatening to derail the agreement
neither mugabe nor tsvangirai was present at the summit though mugabe had
earlier in the day attended armando guebuza inauguration for second five
year term as mozambican president
madagascar rival leaders were also absent though the head of the madagascar
mediation team former mozambican president joaquim chissano was present
disagreements between the island nation four main political groups have
scuttled repeated efforts to end the impasse there with de facto leader
rajoelina trampling on previous deals to form unity government
rajoelina last month fired consensus prime minister and named new one to
replace him
discord over sharing government posts and drawing up an election timetable by
the four political parties have also hobbled efforts to end the crisis
international mediators meeting at african union headquarters in addis ababa
last week called for elections in madagascar to end the prolonged political
crisis none of the island political foes were represented at that meeting
