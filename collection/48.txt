abbas visits egypt for talks on mideast peace
cairo jan afp
palestinian president mahmud abbas arrives in egypt on sunday for talks aimed at
relaunching peace talks with israel amid lingering divisions over jewish
settlement expansion
abbas spokesman nabil abu rudeina said he would meet egyptian president hosni
mubarak at the red sea resort of sharm el sheikh on monday before visiting
qatar and kuwait and turkey later in the week
president abbas will present to president mubarak the important developments
that confront the palestinian cause and the great challenges facing the entire
region he said
his visit comes almost week after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
held talks in cairo with mubarak on the stalled peace process and as diplomats
said washington was drafting letters of guarantees for the peace talks
an arab diplomat told afp last week that us special envoy george mitchell would
present the letters to israel and the palestinian authority on his next visit to
the region
the united states is hoping that the two letters will serve as basis for the
relaunch of israeli palestinian negotiations but we don know if they will
satisfy the palestinians who want complete freeze of settlement activity
before talks resume the diplomat said
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit is also planning to visit washington
for talks with officials on january and has said he will be accompanied by
cairo intelligence chief omar suleiman
us president barack obama has repeatedly called on the two sides to resume peace
talks but the palestinians have demanded israel first freeze all settlement
activity and commit to framework for the talks
egypt saudi arabia and turkey have all urged israel to halt its settlement
activity while saudi foreign minister prince saud al faisal hit out at the
jewish state on saturday for acting like spoiled child
abbas spokesman abu rudeina said there are arab and international efforts to
create the climate to support the return to negotiations with the israeli side
based on complete halt to settlements
he added the palestinians would also require specific guidelines for the
talks including that the borders of future palestinian state encompass all of
their land israel occupied in
the palestinians have insisted that mostly arab east jerusalem occupied by
israel in and later annexed in move not recognised by the international
community be the capital of their future state
the israeli position that we have seen up until now is not encouraging and it
will not be possible to return to the negotiations based on it abu rudeina
said
netanyahu in november imposed month halt on new construction of settlements
in the occupied west bank but excluded east jerusalem public buildings and
housing units already under construction
abbas suspended peace talks with israel after it entered day war with
hamas the islamist rulers of gaza that killed more than palestinians and
left swathes of gaza devastated thirteen israelis were killed
hamas takeover of gaza in which shrank abbas powerbase to the west
bank left deep rift between palestinians that have also hampered peace talks
with israel
egypt has already twice postponed the planned signing of reconciliation
agreement in cairo because of deep divisions between hamas and abbas fatah
supporters
but exiled hamas leader khaled meshaal said during visit sunday to saudi
arabia that reconciliation deal is close

dar es salaam jan afp
ivory coast coach vahid halilhodzic said here on sunday he was concerned about
the fitness of some of his players ahead of the africa cup of nations but was
optimistic of winning the title in angola
the ivorians who are in tanzania to play two build up matches against the hosts
and rwanda later this week are one of the favourites to win the premier african
competition which gets underway in luanda on january

at risk of being fatigued for the tournament
imagine someone plays up to three matches in week players are supposed to
rest but in my team many of the players have lot of responsibilities for
their clubs said halilhodzic at news conference
the team is in high spirits and our focus is to win the africa cup of nations
in angola and we believe dar es salaam is perfect place for the camp ahead of
the tournament he added
football grayson proud as leeds stun manchester united
manchester england jan afp
leeds united manager simon grayson hailed his outstanding team after they
produced one of the great fa cup shocks by knocking out manchester united in
the third round on sunday
jermaine beckford th minute goal gave third tier league one leaders leeds
places below english champions united their first victory at their hosts old
trafford ground in years
it was good ball from jonathan howson and jermaine got in there and nine
times out of he finishes them off and that what he did grayson told itv
he gave us an opportunity to go on and win the game from there and with bit
of luck that what we did the lifelong leeds fan added
full credit to the players who were outstanding today but it what they ve
been like all season

football honours even in old firm derby
glasgow jan afp
rangers retained their seven point advantage at the top of the scottish premier
league as two late goals meant the old firm derby ended at celtic park here
on sunday
super sub scott mcdonald looked to have sealed well deserved win for celtic
when the australian international headed past allan mcgregor with minutes
left
but lee mcculloch nodded in the equaliser two minutes later with his side
first shot on target before mcgregor produced superb save to deny georgios
samaras late winner
am delighted to get point but we were little bit fortunate in the overall
game admitted rangers manager walter smith
we didn play the way we have done in recent weeks and celtic imposed
themselves on the match
his celtic counterpart tony mowbray said he was disappointed his side had not
won
think we did enough to win and the match performance of the team possibly
warranted the three points said mowbray
the players will take great confidence from this game as they did from the
first match at ibrox
celtic will rue host of missed chances including first half marc antoine
fortune goal which was controversially ruled out for foul on mcgregor as the
parkhead side dominated the league leaders who looked pale shadow of the side
which had previously won six successive matches
walter smith was forced to make two changes to the side that put seven past
dundee united with danny wilson replacing madjid bougherra and steven whittaker
in for the suspended kenny miller
rangers game plan was further disrupted when nacho novo was injured in an early
collision with georgios samaras and limped off in the th minute and was
replaced by maurice edu
aiden mcgeady was causing all sorts of problems for rangers down the left wing
as the ibrox side who had scored times in their previous six games
struggled to get out of their own half
celtic thought they had made the breakthrough in the th minute when they had
the ball in the net
mcgeady miss hit shot looked to be covered by mcgregor but fortune leapt above
him to head the ball into the net
however the home side were incensed when referee steve conroy controversially
ruled it out for foul after the striker appeared to make slight contact with
the keeper
kyle lafferty was lucky to stay on the pitch when he was booked on the half hour
mark for high and late challenge on andreas hinkel
danny fox curling free kick went straight to mcgregor before robson rose
unmarked in the box to meet hinkel cross from the right and slam header off
the bar
five minutes from the break mcgeady headed another hinkel cross just wide before
samaras missed golden chance to put celtic ahead as rangers somehow ended the
half on level terms
in the th minute lafferty struck fierce drive from outside the box which was
deflected out for corner by gary caldwell
from the resultant corner celtic broke quickly and irish international mcgeady
sent an angled low shot just by the post
caldwell again came to celtic rescue when he blocked wilson on target half
volley at the edge of the box
misplaced pass from edu allowed fortune to play in mcgeady but he fired high
over the bar
samaras should have done better when he beat wilson but he sent tame shot
straight to mcgregor
mcdonald came on for marc crosas and the australian made an immediate impact
when he gave celtic the lead in the th minute
mcgeady sent over cross from the right and the socceroos striker nodded past
mcgregor from couple of yards out
the lead was short lived and incredibly rangers equalised with their first shot
on target
mcculloch got in front of caldwell to meet steven davis corner and send
downward header bouncing over artur boruc

iran in new threat over uranium swap deal
tehran jan afp
iran said on sunday the west has given it until the end of january to accept
uranium swap deal stressing it will press on with plans to produce higher
enriched nuclear fuel if there is no agreement
tehran has already ignored us set december deadline to accept un brokered
deal aimed at allaying fears about its nuclear drive by shipping most of its low
enriched uranium leu stockpile abroad to be further enriched into reactor
fuel
despite the threat of tougher sanctions iran has rejected the offer drawn up by
the international atomic energy agency iaea and come out with its own proposal
of simultaneous and staged swap of leu with reactor fuel
based on the talks iran had with the relevant parties it was decided to
provide the tehran reactor with the necessary fuel from outside and if not
then we will produce it foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast said
then the negotiating parties asked the islamic republic to give them two
months to reach an understanding and we accepted that news agencies quoted him
as saying
now one month of that waiting period is over and one month is left so if it
does not materialise the provision of fuel then iran will take the necessary
decision
mehmanparast was speaking day after foreign minister manouchehr mottaki gave
the west one month ultimatum to accept the iranian counter proposal
some western powers have dismissed the iranian proposal and called on tehran to
accept the iaea deal or face further sanctions
reacting to mottaki statement the us national security council spokesman mike
hammer said on saturday that the iaea proposal was sufficient
if getting access to fuel is iran objective then there is absolutely no
reason why the existing proposal which iran accepted in principle at geneva is
insufficient the iranian government is standing in its own way hammer said
last month mottaki said iran was open to exchanging uranium on turkish soil the
iaea has ruled out swap taking place in iran itself
world powers have been pushing for iran to accept the un brokered deal and are
also mulling fresh un sanctions after tehran dismissed the year end deadline
iran is already under three sets of un security council sanctions over its
defiance and refusal to suspend enrichment which lies at the heart of
international fears about its nuclear programme
the process that makes nuclear fuel can also be used to make the fissile core of
an atomic bomb
the united states israel and other world powers suspect tehran is making
nuclear bomb under the guise of civilian programme something iran vehemently
denies
the united states is reportedly weighing targeted sanctions against members of
tehran government and most notably the islamic revolutionary guards corps that
runs the country ballistic missile programme
the washington post said on wednesday the us administration wanted targeted
sanctions to avoid alienating the iranian public while keeping the door open to
resolution of the crisis over tehran nuclear programme
the new york times reported on saturday that president barack obama
administration believes domestic unrest and signs of unexpected trouble in
iran nuclear programme make its leaders vulnerable to strong and immediate new
sanctions
meanwhile top israeli official said the un security council will adopt
fresh batch of sanctions against iran within month
the world is uniting against iran nuclear programme and within month we
will see un security council sanctions deputy foreign minister danny ayalon of
tehran arch foe israel said on sunday
