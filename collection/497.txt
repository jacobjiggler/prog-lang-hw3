china defends yuan stance after eu criticism
beijing jan afp
china offered fresh defence of its forex policy on thursday saying stable
yuan was vital for the world after the incoming eu trade chief said beijing
deliberately undervalued the currency
maintaining the stability of the renminbi yuan is important not only to
china economic development but also to the world economy foreign ministry
spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters at regular briefing
jiang had been asked to respond to comments by incoming eu trade commissioner
karel de gucht of belgium who said tuesday that china currency policy was
major problem standing in the way of global economic recovery
it is obvious that the undervaluation of the chinese currency is major
problem de gucht said in comments that highlighted growing eu unease over the
issue
it is clear to me that this is deliberate policy and we should address this
on all possible occasions bilaterally and also multilaterally he said
his criticism of china effective peg of the yuan to weak dollar and how it
undercuts european exporters came after confirmation hearing before lawmakers
in brussels
chinese premier wen jiabao said in november that international pressure over
china currency policy was unfair with beijing insisting that it has done
more than its share to get the global economy back on its feet
the asian giant exports soared percent in december as the nation overtook
germany as the world biggest exporter and illustrating how its economy has got
through the slump better than most
its trade partners especially the united states and the eu have long
complained that weak currency gives china an unfair trade advantage at their
expense
