closing ceremony
olympics vancouver starting to feel nervous buzz of games
los angeles jan afp
olympic red mittens are flying off the shelves as fast as retailers can stock
them and six metre tall downtown clock is counting down the final days and
hours to the winter games
with four weeks to go excitement is building in vancouver as more than
will be on hand to witness the olympic cauldron being lit in bc place stadium
during the opening ceremony
vancouver has sometimes been referred to as the no fun city but organizers and
residents are doing their best to make sure everyone takes home positive image
of canada third largest city
we re moving very fast said john furlong chief executive of the vancouver
games organizing committee
there lot of positive anxiety inside the organization right now we re very
focused on what we have to do
security will be tight during the games with city police military and royal
canadian mounted police on alert for possible protests and terror attacks
recently police have battled to rein in violent ethnic youths who have been
waging bloody gang war in the city suburbs
that makes security one of the biggest costs as an estimated visitors
media and athletes from plus countries will converge on
vancouver for the february games
the budget for security has climbed from an original estimate of million
dollars to million dollars
the kilometre mile torch relay is in full swing as it heads west
en route to bc place stadium
on thursday the olympic torch made its way to the alberta provincial capital of
edmonton before travelling to the winter games host city of calgary on
monday
organizers are hoping there won be repeat of several incidents already where
canada native indians have managed to disrupt the relay
outdoor events will be at the mercy of the weather and forecasters are
predicting severe el nino in february
there is good chance of fog becoming problem in places like whistler which
was dropped from the alpine world cup circuit several years ago because of poor
weather and in the lower elevation ski resort of cypress mountain
organizers have already moved the freestyle and snowboarding competitions at
cypress to the evening under the lights to help beat the fog
weather is already concern at cypress
on wednesday it was decided to close the ski areas to the public two weeks
earlier than planned because of unseasonably warm weather
so far the most popular souvenir has been the more than million pairs of red
mittens with the canadian maple leaf that have been sold at dollars each
while many vancouverites say they are heading out of town during the games to
escape the crowds those that hope to take in the action are being asked to leave
their cars at home
organizers say they have added extra public buses but it remains to be seen how
vancouver undersized transit trains skytrain and its often chaotic public
bus system will handle olympic size crowds
the city has set goal of reducing vehicle traffic in the downtown core by
percent but trial run on friday flopped as just percent of drivers chose
to heed calls to leave their cars at home
with worldwide television audience of three billion expected to watch the
games american broadcaster nbc said last week it would lose money on the
olympics for the first time in recent memory because of higher license fees the
network agreed to pay to show the games
nbc also said advertising revenue would not be enough to offset the high cost of
broadcasting the winter olympics and the summer games
the two billion dollar figure the network paid is one third more than they paid
for the most recent round of olympics
winter olympics advisory
paris jan afp
the winter olympics take place in vancouver from february and with
four weeks to go to the opening ceremony afp sports is about to start filing
its package of advancers
in the build up to the games we will file individual sports previews guides to
the ins and outs of winter sports as well as focus on the stars to watch on the
snow and ice of vancouver and whistler
we will also be filing series of colour stories focussing on national
prospects as well as the offbeat side to the olympics
questions queries etc can be directed to our olympic desk contact is

corrected german inflation at year low of percent official
frankfurt jan afp
german inflation averaged percent in its lowest level since the
country was reunified in final figures released on thursday by the
national statistics office showed
the figure confirmed an estimate first provided on december
in consumer prices gained percent in europe biggest economy
according to data provided by the destatis office
the low year on year rate of price increase in was characterised mainly by
price decreases for mineral oil products and food statement said
lower energy and food prices compared with peaks in have kept inflation
down in germany while rising unemployment has also prevented unions from
demanding substantially higher wages
the last time inflation was anywhere near this low was in when it reached
percent destatis said
inflation even dipped briefly into negative territory in the middle of this
year reaching minus percent in july the lowest rate since
