football klose breaks goal drought to fire bayern top
berlin jan afp
germany striker miroslav klose came off the bench to help fire bayern munich
back to the top of the bundesliga after more than days away as the german
giants beat hoffenheim on friday
despite being top scorer at the world cup this was klose first league
goal of the season and he started the game as third choice striker behind
germany team mate mario gomez and croatia ivica olic
klose took over from olic after minutes and then netted from close range
on minutes to hand louis van gaal bayern single point lead at the top of
the table as action resumed after the long winter break
argentina centre back martin demichelis had opened the scoring for bayern in the
first half
despite the win bayer leverkusen could regain the lead on saturday when they
face mid table mainz
bayern have been crowned german champions times but may was the
last time they had sat on top of the bundesliga
the hosts took the lead at munich allianz arena after minutes when germany
midfielder bastian schweinsteiger crossed in the ball from the right and
hoffenheim defender josip simunic headed the ball onto the back post
demichelis who is set to play for his country against germany in pre world
cup friendly in munich in march stabbed the ball home from five metres out
klose who has only made eight league starts this season proved his status as
germany number one striker with some clinical finishing to make sure van
gaal team claimed the three points
dutch winger arjen robben passed back to captain mark van bommel on the edge of
the penalty area and his speculative shot was stabbed home by klose who was the
fastest to react
with goals for germany in appearances klose showed just why he is injury
permitting almost sure of being in joachim loew squad for the world cup in
south africa in june
the defeat leaves hoffenheim seventh but bayern could still finish the weekend
only third if both leverkusen and schalke who face second from bottom nuremberg
on sunday pick up three points

jpmorgan kicks off bank earnings on strong note
washington jan afp
jpmorgan chase opened the earnings season for banks friday reporting hefty
jump in profits friday highlighting renewed health in sector under intense
scrutiny for its pay practices
the new york based financial giant quadrupled its fourth quarter net earnings to
billion dollars and doubled its profits for the full year to billion
dollars
the results reflected new vigor in the industry after more than year of
crisis but were expected to fuel public resentment over hefty profits and
compensation in sector bailed out by the government and at time when much of
the us economy continues to struggle and unemployment remains high
jamie dimon chairman and chief executive of jpmorgan chase the second largest
bank by assets said he was gratified by the results but lamented that they
fell short of both an adequate return on capital and the firm earnings
potential
while we are seeing some stability in delinquencies consumer credit costs
remain high and weak employment and home prices persist accordingly we remain
cautious he said in statement
the profit for the quarter amounted to cents shares better than the
cents expected by analysts
revenues in the period rose to billion dollars from billion dollars
year earlier for the banking group one of the strongest to emerge from the
global financial crisis
for the profit was billion dollars on billion in revenues up
from earnings of billion dollars in on revenues of billion
the results come with banks in focus for hefty executive pay schemes which
some blame for encouraging risky practices that led to the global crisis
the jpmorgan chase earnings report did not include specific bonus amounts but
reports have indicated that many banks are set to pay record bonuses
wall street journal analysis found wall street banks and securities firms were
on track to pay employees billion dollars for record amount
president barack obama on thursday proposed tax or fee to be assessed on major
banks that would recoup the government bailout for the sector
jpmorgan chase said its investment banking arm posted profit of billion
dollars for the quarter rebounding from loss year earlier another big
profit driver was corporate and private equity with billion dollars
but its retail banking including home lending lost million dollars and
credit card operations lost million
commercial banking operations resulted in profit of million dollars while
treasury and securities operations earned million
despite dimon comments some analysts said the banking giant was hitting its
stride
the bank blew through expectations said douglas mcintyre at wall street
that leaves lot for bank of america and citigroup to live up to
citi was set to report its results tuesday folllowed by bank of america on
wednesday
but shares in jpmorgan fell percent to close at dollars
fred dickson at da davidson amp co said that although the bank profits were
strong its revenues fell slightly short of estimates
last year jpmorgan chase repaid the us treasury for an injection of billion
dollars in capital under program to stabilize the financial system
the repayments which included dividends freed the banks from government
imposed compensation restrictions
still public anger has been boiling over at pay schemes that are blamed for
fueling the crisis
obama unveiled his proposal thursday saying the new fee on risky assets of big
financial institutions was way to recoup the cost of massive bailout of the
sector that began in
we want our money back and we are going to get it obama said adding that his
determination is only heightened when see reports of massive profits and
obscene bonuses at some of the very firms who owe their continued existence to
the american people

football ivory coast into quarters chaos reigns at cup of nations
luanda jan afp
day six of the africa cup of nations had ivory coast beaming mali fuming and
algeria left out in the cold by their national media and accused of gamesmanship
by organisers
friday lone action came from cabinda where competition favourites ivory coast
became the first of the nations cup teams to reach the quarter finals
they did it the hard way defeating severely depleted ghana with men
the elephants were down player on minutes when arsenal defender emmanuel
eboue was red carded for vicious tackle from behind on opoku agyemang
by then lille forward kouassi gervinho had already put them in front siaka
tiene scored direct from free kick after minutes and chelsea striker didier
drogba completed the victory in the final minute
ghana got stoppage time consolation goal via an asamoah gyan penalty after he
had been fouled by souleman bamba
victory lifted the title favourites to four points from two matches
ghana or burkina faso will join them in the last eight in group which was
reduced to three teams with togo defection following the deadly attack on
their team bus
down in luanda what should have been routine training session degenerated into
high drama farce and recrimination
everything began normally at the escoqueirus stadium when algeria turned up to
prepare for monday must win group clash with hosts angola
but waiting reporters were astonished when quarter of an hour later the mali
team bus rounded corner and parked outside the stadium
utter confusion then reigned as first mali players including real madrid
midfielder and national team captain mahamadou diarra and african
footballer of the year frederic kanoute were made to wait in the coach for over
half an hour
then they were told they could enter the ground only to find the doors locked
diarra and some of his fellow team mates attempted to gain access by clambering
through an open window while kanoute and mali nigerian coach stephen keshi
tried to talk their way in at the main gate but to no avail
after over an hour and as dusk fell keshi led his charges away furious at
having missed vital chance to prepare for their last group match against
malawi in cabinda on monday
keshi told afp fed up how could this happen to get the boys in bus and
travel to ground and be told you can train don know whose fault it is
barcelona midfielder seydou keita added defiantly they can do what they like
but we re still going to qualify for the quarter finals
the africa cup of nations organising committee loc laid the blame firmly with
algeria
loc media officer virgilio santos explained this mix up had nothing to do with
us what happened was this mali were supposed to travel to cabinda today but
delayed their trip until saturday
algeria were supposed to train at the stadium until but when they saw the
mali team turn up they decided to make life difficult for mali and they didn
leave the pitch until which made mali angry
in separate subplot the algeria team were cold shouldered by their local press
who were angry at being refused entry to watch the training session
the desert foxes press pack formed human wall and turned their backs on the
players as they left the stadium
relationships between the two sides are fraught after coach rabah saadane took
exception to the criticism which followed his side opening defeat to
malawi

nba arenas faces jail after pleading guilty to gun charge
washington jan afp
washington wizards guard gilbert arenas pleaded guilty in superior court on
friday to felony charge of carrying an unlicensed pistol which should mean
jail time for the three time nba all star
the charge carries maximum sentence of five years behind bars but prosecutors
are recommending arenas serve no more than six months as part of plea bargain
to obtain an admission of guilt that puts his nba career at risk
arenas admitted bringing four guns to the wizards locker room on december but
faced only one charge under terms of the deal although judge robert morin will
not be bound by the six month limit when he sentences arenas on march
he accepted full responsibility for his actions acknowledged that those
actions were wrong and against the law and has apologized to all who have been
affected by his conduct arenas lawyer kenneth wainstein said in statement
arenas on indefinite suspension by the nba was released until sentencing after
surrendering his passport and being instructed not to possess handguns of any
sort
the guilty plea leaves his nba career in limbo opening the door for the wizards
to void his million dollar contract and dump the four years on it
playing with firearms is no joke us attorney channing phillips said
today guilty plea to felony count of carrying pistol without license
reflects the seriousness and grave risk of such conduct
we commend mr arenas for accepting responsibility and hope he fully
appreciates the gravity of his actions
arenas and teammate javaris crittenton argued over gambling losses during card
game on flight december when crittenton said he should shoot arenas in his
often repaired knee
two days later arenas put four guns on chair near crittenton locker with
note saying pick one in what he later called joke
arenas told authorities that crittenton pulled gun of his own in the locker
room police searched crittenton apartment on thursday but seized no evidence
authorities said probe into crittenton actions is ongoing
arenas was suspended indefinitely last week by nba commissioner david stern
after using his fingers as pretend pistols and firing at teammates before
game stern calling arenas not currently fit to take the court
goof ball and that what am so even doing something like this
going to make fun of it and that how am arenas said in twitter message
about the incident
arenas found guilty of possessing an unregistered gun in said he brought
the guns to the locker room to keep them out of reach of his children and was
unaware doing so violated not only nba rules but strict gun laws in the us
capital
the wizards took down banner outside their arena featuring arenas and dropped
agent zero from pre game video
even jerseys bearing his number zero are no longer on display in the souvenir
shop vanishing act for the once most marketable wizard
arenas played just games since signing his wizards contract largely
because of knee injuries he was averaging points and assists game
