groups have complained of repeated police harassment arbitrary arrests and
rendition of muslims suspected of terrorism
faisal lawyers and rights groups have complained that the cleric is being held
without charge
the december arrest of faisal who police and immigration officials said
violated immigration regulations by preaching heralded the latest in string
of protests by the muslims
faisal was arrested in britain in after spending years urging his
audiences to kill jews hindus and westerners
kenya attempts to deport the cleric first to tanzania and then to gambia have
failed due to the refusal by authorities and airlines to grant him entry

text haiti to or yele to americans are digging deep for haiti and
sending millions of dollars to relief organizations via innovative mobile phone
giving campaigns
mobile phone campaign set up by the us red cross to raise money for victims of
the cataclysmic earthquake in haiti had raised more than eight million dollars
early friday with the money pouring in at the rate of dollars an hour
officials said
us donors were donating dollars at time for the haiti relief effort by
texting the word haiti to special cellphone number set up within hours
of the quake by the american red cross with help from the state department
spokeswoman for the us red cross abi weaver said the mobile giving campaign
passed the seven million dollar mark at pm gmt on thursday two
days after the powerful quake struck the impoverished caribbean island state
reducing much of the capital port au prince to rubble
as far as we know this has broken all global mobile marketing campaigns in
history the money is coming in at rate of dollars an hour weaver
told afp
the mobile phone campaign brought in around quarter of all donations that
poured into the american red cross in the hours after the powerful quake
rocked haiti and makes up the lion share of funds that have been earmarked to
help victims of the temblor weaver said
as of last night we had received million dollars in donations million
of which including the texting funds has been designated specifically for
haiti
but we are doing damage assessment and we do anticipate that we will be
spending more than the million for sure for haiti weaver said
similar text message campaign run by yele haiti grassroots group founded by
former fugees singer wyclef jean who has haitian roots has raised more than
two million dollars
somewhere in the vicinity of dollars came in the first evening roughly
million dollars on the second day and another million on thursday albert

five dollars are donated to help desperate quake survivors in haiti and relief
and rescue work each time the word yele is sent to the number and
donors can re text the message up to six times
four other organizations the clinton foundation international medical corps
international rescue committee and salvation army are taking donations of
five or dollars for the relief effort delivered by the simple act of texting
the word haiti to special mobile phone numbers
the amount donated appears on donors monthly phone bills and percent of
the pledged amount is remitted by the phone service provider to the mobile
giving foundation which is coordinating the six groups cellphone giving
campaign in the united states
mobile giving then passes the funds on to the donor chosen cause
the carriers are aware that normal processing poses some challenges in an
emergency situation so discussions are taking place to see what can be done
to get mobile phone providers to advance funds for relief work to the
organizations working on the ground jim manis chairman of the mobile giving
foundation told afp
according to adriene davis of the center on philanthropy at indiana university
in indianapolis which monitors disaster fundraising us donors gave
billion dollars for relief and aid efforts after the asian tsunami in late
more than million dollars was raised within the first five days of the
disaster all from us individuals foundations and corporations davis said
we have sense that mobile phone fundraising both from the standpoint of
organizations making the appeals and from the standpoint of donors is much
larger phenomenon this time than it ever has been in past disasters davis told

micronesia upset over co emission plans at czech plant
prague jan afp
micronesia part of the oceania group of islands threatened by rising sea levels
due to climate change has slammed revamp plans for coal fired czech plant as
not good enough the environment ministry said friday
micronesian environment official andrew yatilman said in letter to the czech
ministry that renovation plans for the prunerov ii heating plant would not
reduce carbon dioxide emissions sufficiently
it said the czech state run cez energy group would not use the so called best
available technology bat
cez current renovation plans regarding the prunerov ii power plant would
lower co emissions from million tonnes to million tonnes of co per
annum but if they used bat it would be lowered further to million tonnes
per annum yatilman said
over period of years the difference will amount to nine million tonnes of
co emissions he said
as far as we know the prunerov ii power plant is the th biggest source of
greenhouse gases in the european union this single power plant emits
approximately times more than the entire federated states of micronesia
yatilman noted
but yatilman conceded that the plant is estimated to be responsible for
percent of annual global co emissions
although we are aware that greenhouse gas emissions produced solely by the
prunerov ii power plant will not directly cause sea level rise change weather
patterns and increase storms there are approximately only such power
plants which contribute to total global co emissions yatilman said
czech environment ministry spokeswoman jarmila krebsova told afp our position
will be included in our final report on the renovation project

people the french statement said
french military forces based in gabon capital libreville will also go into
action this month to provide air transport to impfondo in the likouala region
of the extreme north of the republic of congo
the aim is to fly vehicles boats and other material useful for the un high
commissioner for refugees to this remote part of the country where refugees
have settled close to waterways
according to the unhcr about people have crossed the oubangui river
border to flee inter ethnic violence that shook part of the dr congo equateur
province between october and december
relief workers trying to help the refugees have complained that they lack the
means
the unhcr has begun to carry out census of the refugees in the betou district
of likouala province which is thought to be home to about percent of those
who fled said statement from the un agency received in kinshasa
the other refugees are scattered around the impfondo district further south
along kilometre mile stretch of territory besides the oubangui
river
carrying out proper census is logistically difficult and has taken several
weeks of preparation because most of the refugees live in zones that are
accessible only by boat
in the central african republic where people have taken shelter our
teams have carried out the registration of refugees in december and continue
to register further refugees the unhcr added
