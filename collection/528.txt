percent in the first quarter of even with jobs created because the labor
force will grow with new entrants and discouraged workers resuming their
search for jobs
the forecast called for the unemployment rate to drop to percent by the end
of even though the economists expect some two million jobs to be added
we do expect the economy is on the cusp of private sector job creations
hoffman said
the said this will occur in conjunction with handoff from the public sector
to the private sector in stimulating the economy
the aba forecast suggests the federal reserve would begin raising interest rates
in the third quarter from the base level of zero to percent with the year
end level hitting percent
hoffman said that higher rates would be viewed more as sign of recovery than
threat to recovery
the panel said the members expected inflation to remain tame with core prices
up just percent for the year

if you decide to come to club you don look at recent form and whether
results are going for or against you rodriguez said on friday
they are great club with great tradition and you don change your mind on
something like that because of short period of results
the important thing is to come here with that desire to win work hard make
the team even more competitive and first of all try to win my place in the side
by hard work we will turn things around will be putting in lots of hard
work putting myself on the line for my team and team mates because that is
important

it wouldn be the start everyone had dreamed of but the thing about it is all
the players are convinced we can turn things around he added
the main thing is to have strong belief and mentality in football you can
get bad start or bad run in the middle of the season but the important thing
is to stop concentrating on the negatives and think positively
they are convinced as much as am that it can be turned around and with
couple of victories you can get the confidence back and results will improve

hong kong protesters urge tsang to drop railway project
hong kong jan afp
more than protesters gathered outside the residence of hong kong chief
executive donald tsang late friday to demand the withdrawal of controversial
billion dollar railway project
the group including many university students marched to tsang home after
lawmakers for the second time failed to reach decision on whether to give the
go ahead for the high speed rail project that would link the city to
neighbouring guangzhou
withdraw the proposal stop the fund allocation the crowd chanted to the
sound of beating drums under the gaze of large team of police officers
officials say the project is important to foster economic ties between hong kong
and major chinese cities on the mainland and hope construction will be completed
by around
critics say the public has not been properly consulted and question the cost of
the scheme they also say it will benefit only developers while forcing
villagers along the route to relocate
joao li secondary school teacher said he and his students joined the protest
to show their frustration with the authorities
it is so sad to listen to the speeches made by government officials and pro
establishment lawmakers they were not being honest about the railway project
this precisely shows what can go wrong in place without democracy he told
afp
at present only half of hong kong legislature is directly elected while
largely pro beijing committee effectively controls the selection of the
remainder and appoints the city chief executive
the protesters began to disperse peacefully after midnight but many said they
would join the protest saturday morning when lawmakers meet again to continue
their debate on the railway project
we want to have dialogue with donald tsang we have been here for hours and
he is hiding in his house said kan cheuk hang university student
the former british colony was returned to chinese rule in and its citizens
unlike many other parts of china enjoy the freedom to protest
