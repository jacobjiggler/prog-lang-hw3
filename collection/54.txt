iran says west agreed to wait over nuclear proposal
tehran jan afp
iran said on sunday the west had agreed to wait two months on proposal to
exchange enriched uranium and that month has now passed reiterating that if
there is no deal it will produce its own fuel for nuclear reactor
based on the talks iran had with the relevant parties it was decided to
provide the tehran reactor with the necessary fuel from outside and if not
then we will produce it foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast was
quoted by news agencies as saying
then the negotiating parties asked the islamic republic to give them two
months to reach an understanding and we accepted that he added
now one month of that waiting period is over and one month is left so if it
does not materialise the provision of fuel then iran will take the necessary
decision mehmanparast said
he spoke day after foreign minister manouchehr mottaki gave the west one
month ultimatum to accept uranium swap
the international community has just one month left to decide whether or not
it will accept iran conditions otherwise tehran will enrich uranium to
higher level he was quoted by the state television as saying
this is an ultimatum mottaki added
iran which rejected december deadline to accept un brokered deal said
on tuesday it is ready to swap abroad its low enriched uranium for nuclear fuel
insisting however that the exchange should happen in stages
tehran has rejected proposal by un nuclear watchdog the international atomic
energy agency iaea to ship out most of its stockpile of low enriched uranium
for further processing by russia and france into fuel for the research reactor
last month mottaki said iran was open to exchanging uranium on turkish soil the
iaea has ruled out swap taking place in iran itself
world powers have been pushing for iran to accept the un brokered deal and are
also mulling fresh un sanctions after tehran dismissed the year end deadline
the united states israel and other world powers suspect tehran is making an
atomic bomb under the guise of civilian nuclear programme iran denies the
charge

peshawar pakistan jan afp

health department is responsible for all this most of the people died on their
way to other hospitals mannawar khan member of parliament from the
district told afp
the health minister for north west frontier province conceded that only one
doctor out of at the hospital in lakki marwat had been on duty conceding
limited health care had caused more human losses
after the blast several hours passed but the other doctors didn come

been constituted syed zahir ali shah told afp

adjacent to the bhitni area of south waziristan and the bomber came from that
area district police chief mohammad ayub khan told afp

years after death camus again at heart of controversy
paris jan afp
fifty years after his death the writer albert camus is again the focus of
controversy as the left accuses french president nicolas sarkozy of trying to
co opt thinker they claim as their own
camus when he died in paris car crash on january aged only was
one of the leading literary figures of his day having won the nobel literature
prize in
but sarkozy proposal in november to honour him by having his remains installed
in the pantheon the resting place for french national heroes provoked wave
of protest from france left
many commentators argued that sarkozy was trying to exploit the left wing
philosopher legacy for political gain and among those objecting was the
writer son jean camus
his daughter catherine however objected that the critics were themselves using
the memory of her father for their own ends
have seen my father being transformed into an anti sarkozy missile she told
rtl radio
but she did admit she was surprised that the president had proposed to honour
her father in this way
men of power do not usually like camus she said
born on november in algeria camus came from very poor background
but his potential was quickly spotted by teacher who encouraged him to develop
his talents
he published his first book at the age of then moved to paris
when much of france was occupied by the nazis during world war ii he became
active in the resistance writing for and editing the underground newspaper
combat
by the end of the war in camus had already published number of key works
including the stranger and the myth of sisyphus both in
the stranger also titled the outsider in some english editions became
an international bestseller
the story of curiously emotionless man white algerian who shoots an arab
dead it is told in the spare and limpid style for which camus became known
camus writing both his fiction and non fiction was about the search for
meaning in life and the need to revolt
while associated with the left he was nevertheless very much his own man
intellectually
in when the united states dropped an atomic bomb on the japanese city of
hiroshima he was one of the few western intellectuals to denounce it
but unlike many radical writers of his generation he also denounced the
totalitarianism of the soviet union clashing bitterly on this question with
jean paul sartre the other leading french intellectual of the day
for his biographer olivier todd camus was dangerous writer challenging
the ideological dogma that the end justified the means
he forces us to question lot of our convictions he told afp
the idea of his remains finishing up in the pantheon is anathema to todd
that has nothing at all to do with his personality he insisted
catherine camus has still not said whether she would like to see her father
honoured in this way
but she regrets the fact that despite camus popularity among french readers
the archives over which she presides currently attract far more interest from
foreign academics than french researchers
in this anniversary year however she is looking forward to renewal of interest
in her father
she herself published book on him in december his french publishers gallimard
have announced they are reissuing some of his works
and his unfinished novel the first man is being adapted for the cinema by the
italian director gianni amelio

cricket cricket england grab early wickets
cape town south africa jan afp
england grabbed two early wickets after sending south africa in to bat on the
first day of the third test against south africa at newlands on sunday
south africa were for two at lunch after rain shortened morning captain
graeme smith was unbeaten on after james anderson and graham onions took the
wickets of ashwell prince and hashim amla
england captain andrew strauss decision to bowl first was justified with the
fourth ball of the match after rain delayed the start by half an hour when
prince edged anderson to wicketkeeper matt prior
south africa could have been two down three balls later when smith on one
edged graham onions first delivery into the midriff of graeme swann at second
slip but swann could not hold the chance
although regular second slip paul collingwood was passed fit to play he was
fielding at fine leg to prevent further damage to dislocated left index
finger
amla survived television review after he was given not out by umpire daryl
harper after an appeal for catch behind off stuart broad when he had eight
but he added only six more runs before he was trapped leg before wicket by
onions
fast bowler makhaya ntini was dropped from the south african team and replaced
by friedel de wet
the match started in overcast conditions but by lunch most of the clouds had
disappeared
england who lead the four match series fielded the same team that won the
second test in durban by an innings and runs
malaysian government to appeal allah ruling minister
kuala lumpur jan afp
malaysia minister in charge of muslim affairs has said the government will
appeal court ruling allowing catholic paper the right to use the word
allah
malaysia high court ruled last week the herald weekly had the right to use the
word allah after long running dispute between the government and the
newspaper in the muslim majority nation
the paper has been using the word as translation for god in its malay
language section but the government argued the word should be used only by
muslims
jamil khir johari said the country national fatwa council had ruled in may
that allah could only be used by muslims in malaysia state news agency
bernama reported late saturday
it is important for muslims here to guard the use of the word and if there is
any attempt to insult or misuse the word we must take all legal action as
allowed under the federal constitution he was quoted as saying by bernama
premier najib razak urged people to remain calm saying he was concerned about
reactions to the court decision
the issue is very sensitive and touches on the feelings of muslims we need to
be calm now and let the matter be resolved through the courts he was quoted as
saying by bernama sunday
meanwhile the herald website was hacked at the weekend causing the site to
shut down editor father lawrence andrew told afp
our website was attacked by hackers and was shut down and we suspect it was
done by those unhappy with the present situation he said while declining to
comment on the government plan to appeal
the court ruled on thursday the catholic paper had the constitutional right to
use the word allah declaring the government ban on the word illegal null
and void
muslim groups have said they plan to protest the ruling
universiti teknologi mara political analyst shahruddin badaruddin said the main
issue among muslims was the fear that the use of the word by non muslims would
inflame religious tensions
it is all about the fear that allowing use of the word will make it easier for
christians to convert the local population he told afp
former premier mahathir mohamad said the use of the term had to be governed
strictly but that muslims would still be angry over the ruling according to the
new straits times
the herald is printed in four languages with circulation of week in
country with about catholics
the court case was one of string of religious disputes that have erupted in
recent years straining relations between muslim malays and minority ethnic
chinese and indians who fear the country is being islamised
