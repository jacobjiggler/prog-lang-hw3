the group remains united remains committed to the two track approach of
sanctions while pursuing negotiations the eu official said
that implies that we will continue to seek negotiation solution but
consideration of appropriate further measures sanctions has also begun he
pointedly noted
earlier russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov emerged from the
meeting saying it was inconclusive in the sense that we did not make any
decisions right away
we have started the next chapter of this saga the next part of the process as
said russia has always been fully committed to the dual track approach he
said
we have talked today about the second track but it does not mean that we
should abandon the first one the engagement policy
us under secretary of state william burns only aid that the six had useful
discussion
his french counterpart jacques audibert stressed that it was not meeting to
make decisions
diplomatic sources said the eu hosted meeting was preceded by two hour
gathering of the four western members of the group
us secretary of state hillary clinton said monday that the six would explore
the kind and degree of sanctions that we should be pursuing as iran doggedly
refused to comply with un demands to halt uranium enrichment
measures said to be under consideration include tougher sanctions targeting
iran insurance financial and arms sectors
the goal is to increase the pressure so iran will accept un brokered deal
aimed at allaying suspicions about the nature of its nuclear program
washington and its western allies fear that iran is secretly developing fissile
material for nuclear weapons under the cover of its uranium enrichment program
but iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward
generating electricity for its civilian population
washington along with britain france and germany have for months sought to
convince russia and china that the time has come to get tougher with the islamic
republic which has already ignored three sets of security council sanctions
diplomats noted that moscow having seen its mediation efforts rebuffed by
tehran has signaled it is prepared to turn up the heat on the iranians
but china which has close economic and energy ties with iran has said new
sanctions would be premature and that more time should be given for diplomacy to
work
also at the meeting were kang yong counselor at china un mission geoffrey
adams of britain and emily haber of germany

washington jan afp
the pentagon has for the first time made public the names of detainees held
at the us military base in bagram afghanistan us human rights group said
saturday
the american civil liberties union said the list of names dated september
was released by the us defense secretary after the group filed freedom

heavily censored form the aclu said
vital information including their citizenship how long they have been held in
what country they were captured and the circumstances of their capture has been
redacted the group said in statement
the ages of the detainees was also not provided
hundreds of people have languished at bagram for years in horrid and abusive
conditions without even being told why they re detained or given fair chance
to argue for release said aclu lawyer melissa goodman
the aclu filed lawsuit seeking the information in september after an
april request was rejected by the defense department and central intelligence
agency
since us president barack obama announced his administration would work to close
the prison at guantanamo where detainees remain human rights groups have
turned their attention to the us prison at bagram
nato and afghanistan signed an agreement in early january authorizing the
transfer of the prison to afghan authorities though no date was set for the
handover

facility to view some of the evidence against them and the right to challenge
their detention before limited military tribunals
in the united states courts are considering whether non afghan detainees who
were captured outside of afghanistan should have access to the us justice system
to challenge their detention
