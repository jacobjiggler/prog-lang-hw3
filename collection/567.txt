remains about the lack of coordination at the airport and across devastated

the haitians haven been notified about the arrival of planes and when they
do land there no one to take charge and large amount of goods are arriving
without coordination said haitian government official michel chancy
on port au prince streets the consequences of the coordination breakdown are
clear as traumatized and starving quake survivors approached passing foreigner

football bari hold inter again to boost milan hopes
rome jan afp
bari breathed new life into the serie title race by holding champions inter
milan to draw for the second time this season after stalemate that
included three penalties
inter who were down at one stage now lead city rivals ac milan by nine
points but the rossonero have two games in hand with the derby to come next
weekend
but while inter coach jose mourinho may feel this was two points dropped as was
the case when inter hosted the southerners on the opening day of the season
this result was testament to inter powers of recovery
two paulo baretto penalties looked to have given bari victory but macedonia
striker goran pandev pulled goal back before argentine strike partner diego
milito penalty earned the champions share of the spoils
mourinho was not entirely happy with the result and pointed to his side
penalty claiming bari should have had leonardo bonucci dismissed
obviously satisfied with the comeback because if you re losing away
against side of this quality it not easy to get draw but obviously
not satisfied we conceded two goals said mourinho
after conceding two penalties in five minutes the game seemed lost but the lads
showed great character to earn point that seemed lost
you can never say if in football but if bari had played with men at the end
and with no centre back left on the bench there would have been different
result
few clear cut chances were created in the first half but bari clearly had the
better of things with honduran winger edgar alvarez pace causing considerable
problems for makeshift left back ivan cordoba
and it was alvarez who had the first clear sight of goal on minutes as
massimo donati pass found gap between cordoba and centre back lucio with the
honduran racing on to the ball but with only julio cesar to beat he fired
against the goalkeeper legs
four minutes later hungarian vladimir koman slipped the ball wide to overlapping
left back alessandro parisi and his fierce drive was beaten away by julio cesar
inter seemed to be coming back into the match early in the second period as
wesley sneijder struck powerful free kick from distance wide out on the left
only for belgian goalkeeper jean francois gillet to tip the ball around the
post
from the resulting corner milito shot was blocked and cordoba sliced the
rebound wide
but the game changed on two penalties the first given when riccardo
meggiorini cross from the left hit walter samuel arm
baretto sent julio cesar the wrong way to open the scoring on the hour
and just three minutes later lucio gave away another penalty after clumsily
bundling parisi over in the box
baretto shot to the other corner this time again sending julio cesar the wrong
way
mourinho response was immediate throwing on winger ricardo quaresma and full
back davide santon
inter were soon level after some shoddy bari defending
mario balotelli shot from distance on minutes hit andrea masiello and
pandev was quickest to react to the loose ball to slot home
five minutes later ricochet played pandev in behind the bari defence and
bonucci brought him down with milito despatching the third spot kick of the
game
mourinho wasn happy that bonucci wasn sent off and disputed the penalty
against samuel
haven seen tv replay but it seems to me that there were many questions on
the first penalty he said
and then there seems to be special rule for us early in the season against
milan gennaro gattuso didn get red card for foul as the last man and
again here if this isn red card then ve nothing to say
if pandev is behind the defence and bonucci is the last man then why isn it
red card
alvarez had chance to win the game when played in by baretto but his first
touch was far too heavy and julio cesar cleared
earlier in the day cagliari went sixth just three points off champions league
position with defeat of livorno
clinton flies to haiti to boost aid effort
port au prince jan afp
us secretary of state hillary clinton arrived in haiti saturday to meet
president rene preval and help speed up an urgent bid to clear logistical
hurdles to deliver aid to quake hit haitians
clinton who arrived in the devastated capital port au prince aboard us coast
guard plane shortly before gmt is the highest ranking us official to visit
haiti since tuesday deadly quake
on landing she headed into tent set up at the port au prince airport the
hub of the massive international relief operation for talks with the head of
the us military relief operations in haiti lieutenant general ken keen us
ambassador kenneth merten and us agency for international development usaid
administrator rajiv shah
she then met for about an hour with president rene preval clinton said before
arriving she would ask how the united states could help tackle fuel shortages
and other logistical problems that were dogging the relief effort
she wanted to listen to him to be sure we are as responsive as we need to be
clinton and usaid director shah said the un world food program had begun setting
up food and water distribution centers at points across the capital we re
looking to expand that shah said
clinton said criticism that aid was piling up at the airport was unfair saying
us forces in charge of the airport were getting it out as quickly as possible
shah said he understood some distribution points were already working roads had
been cleared and the us military is prepared to provide security at these sites
as well as transport supplies to them
clinton made clear that the brazil led un force deployed for years in the
country with wide knowledge and local informants was responsible for security
we are working to back them up but not to supplant them she said
the us military was also trying to establish helicopter landing zones for some
aid deliveries but had to drop the plan when it realized haitians would mob the
site each time and make it dangerous to land she said
aid would also be shipped aid outside the capital as haitians were beginning to
trickle out to the less damaged areas of the country she said
the other thing we re trying to do is get our helicopters outside the
immediately affected area outside of port au prince because people are leaving
the city clinton said
they are seeking medical help they are trying to get to relatives she added
the countryside is relatively unaffected we re trying to get ahead of the
curve here
she noted that number of injured haitians managed to reach hospital about
miles kilometers outside the capital but it was now full of patients
clinton said state department officials had asked the us military whether
supplies could be parachuted to haitians but heard they won do that they
don think that good idea it too dangerous
you can do that in rural areas in urban areas it causes riots and causes
injuries to people she said noting that packages could fall on crowds
philip crowley clinton spokesman said there were hopes to make the northern
city of cap haitien operational as container port which would give the
country second port but he gave no details
when clinton departs haiti she will take with her us citizens who had been
living in haiti some of them to jamaica and others to the united states
officials said
ann young lee relief worker with the humanitarian aid group chf international
and one of six relief workers on clinton plane said she is based in haiti but
was on leave when the quake struck
it been tough hearing what happened lee said the haiti knew and love is
not going to be there just trying to brace myself for it

un confirms death of its mission chief in haiti
fearful haitians flee capital as aid trickles in
port au prince jan afp
desperate haiti quake survivors pleaded for vital supplies saturday amid anger
over the failure to coordinate the chaotic aid effort as us troops struggled to
clear the logjam
four days after magnitude earthquake brought death and misery on an
unprecedented scale to the impoverished and dysfunctional caribbean nation aid
was trickling in but failing to reach many of those most in need
us helicopters were flying and unloading boxes of vital supplies as massive
queues formed at distribution points where the un world food programme handed
out high energy biscuits to thousands of starving port au prince residents
an afp journalist witnessed one us helicopter dropping half dozen small
cartons into stadium of starving haitians some brandishing machetes as they
fought for this manna from heaven
as the fate of whole towns and villages around the capital in western haiti
remained unclear the united nations said it had never before faced such
humanitarian catastrophe
this is historic disaster we have never been confronted with such disaster
in the un memory it is like no other elisabeth byrs spokeswoman of the un
office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told afp in geneva
un team visiting leogane west of the capital found percent of
buildings there were damaged or destroyed with police estimating up to
people could be dead in that town alone
haitian officials say at least people have been killed by the quake and
million left homeless but that toll figure could still soar once the full
extent of the tragedy is known
the un said increasing numbers of haitians were trying to cross the border into
neighboring dominican republic to the east and reported surge of quake
survivors fleeing the disaster zone to northern cities
crammed onto overflowing buses or on foot thousands fled the flattened capital
where the stench of decomposing bodies hung in the air and fears grew of angry
riots in the tense aftermath of tuesday quake
the streets smell of death said talulum saint fils who sold her jewelry for
one way bus tickets for her husband and their four children out of port au
prince
go to any place but away from this city she told afp there is no
assistance of any kind and our children simply cannot live like animals
haitian aid official michel clancy complained of major coordination problems
at the us operated airport in port au prince and said that when planes land
there is no one in charge
france secretary of state for cooperation alain joyandet said he had lodged an
official complaint with the us after french plane carrying field hospital
was turned away this was later denied by his own foreign ministry
secretary of state hillary clinton became the highest ranking us official to
visit haiti since the quake warmly embracing haitian president rene preval in
an air conditioned tent near the airport
clinton highlighted the urgent need to clear the logistical hurdles telling
reporters she wanted to listen to him preval to be sure we are as responsive
as we need to be
back in washington president barack obama rounded up the unlikely duo of
predecessors george bush and bill clinton for united aid pledge for haiti
and said the united states was doing its utmost to help
at this moment we re moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in
our history to save lives and to deliver relief that averts an even larger
catastrophe obama said
despite the row over coordination significant amount of aid was getting
through either through the swamped airport at port au prince by road from the
dominican republic or from us helicopter flights
bustamante said the red cross had sent planeloads of personnel and
humanitarian aid over the past four days while fleet of choppers on board
the giant aircraft carrier uss carl vinson was making regular air drops
the us was participating in coordination meetings every morning with other
donors and food rations were being delivered to distribution points said
senior us agency for international development usaid official tim callaghan
hope of finding new survivors was fading fast but callaghan said us search and
rescue efforts would continue at least till sunday
after isolated reports friday of machete wielding gangs terrorizing survivors
overnight there were growing signs saturday of unease in country with
checkered past of rioting and unrest
barricades of burning tires rubble and human corpses blocked the main road out
of the haitian capital to nearby carrefour on saturday as residents called for
piles of putrid corpses to be removed
they already took some bodies away but there are more many more said

football magnificent seven boosts chelsea title push
london jan afp
chelsea reasserted their credentials as premier league title favourites on
saturday with demolition of sunderland that manager carlo ancelotti hailed
as their best performance of the season
manchester united who have played game more than the leaders remained one
point off the pace after win over burnley at old trafford
but it was another frustrating day for liverpool who conceded last minute
equaliser at stoke and wasted an opportunity to close the gap on manchester city
and tottenham in the battle for top four places
with city going down to defeat at everton their first loss since roberto
mancini took over as manager last month spurs were able to edge them out of the
champions league qualifying places thanks to goalless draw at home to hull
chelsea were irresistible at stamford bridge where nicolas anelka and frank
lampard both scored twice on an afternoon when they might easily have reached
doube figures
florent malouda ashley cole and michael ballack also found the net with
boudewijn zenden and darren bent providing consolation efforts for steve bruce
outclassed side
ancelotti was delighted to see his side prove they could thrive in the absence
of didier drogba michael essien john mikel obi and salomon kalou all of whom
are away at the african cup of nations
ve always said we have fantastic squad and today we have done good job
the italian said
there were no such fireworks at old trafford where the manchester united
faithful had to wait until the th minute before dimitar berbatov broke
burnley resistance
wayne rooney th goal of the season and substitute mame biram diouf first
for the club made sure that brian laws first match in charge of burnley ended
in defeat
ferguson praised senegalese striker diouf who joined from norwegian club fc
molde
he got great spring he quick and he looks to run behind the defenders all
the time and he very good in the air said the united boss
second half goal from sotirios kyrgiakos had looked like it would be enough to
ease the pressure on liverpool manager rafael benitez following the club fa
cup exit to championship side reading earlier in the week
but the defensive frailty that has hampered liverpool throughout the campaign
was exposed again in the th minute when robert huth scrambled in an equaliser
after the visitors had failed to clear corner
having been denied what appeared to be clear penalty in the first half
liverpool suffered further frustration when dirk kuyt headed against the post in
the fifth minute of injury time
it feels like defeat admitted kuyt we aren playing the best football at
the moment but thought we fought really hard for this result and to concede
in the last minute and even miss great chance in the last minute is
unbelievable
the draw left liverpool languishing in seventh place although the failure of
tottenham and manchester city to win limited the damage for benitez men
city had begun life under mancini with four straight wins but they flunked their
first serious test at goodison park
steven pienaar free kick and louis saha penalty earned everton thoroughly
deserved victory and lifted david moyes side into the top half of the table
for the first time this season
wigan pulled away from the relegation zone with win at fellow strugglers
wolves in match both teams ended with ten men
wolves defender richard stearman received second yellow card when he conceded
first half penalty marcus hahnemann saved hugo rodallega spot kick but
wigan made their numerical advantage count though james mccarthy on the hour
the numbers were evened up when wigan midfielder hendry thomas was ordered off
shortly afterwards but charles zogbia made sure of the points for the
visitors
