enormous pressure on their shoulders and duly netted the match winner after
minutes

they have six points from three matches while nigeria moved into second place
on three points after they stopped benin
mozambique slipped goal down in the th minute when defender khan again put
the ball through his own goal off powerful low cross from the right by egypt

it was the unfortunate khan second own goal in as many matches in the
tournament after also scoring against his own team in tuesday draw with
benin
egypt had to wait until the st minute before they could double their lead
nagy second half replacement for mohamed zidan took his chance very well
when he smashed home left footed shot into the roof of the mozambique goal

egypt have now compiled game unbeaten run in the cup of nations since the
tournament in tunisia
we are very proud of this record said egypt skipper ahmed hassan but most
importantly we won today against very strong mozambique

in the th minute mozambique forward goncalves fumo tried an ambitious shot
from about yards but it posed no problem for essam el hadary in the egypt
goal
in the th minute rafael pushed goal bound low drive by shikabala from
yards away for corner
three minutes later the same player lobbed the ball over an onrushing
mozambique goalkeeper only for samuel chapanga to clear the danger
the best action in the first half came in stoppage time when egypt launched
counter attack which released emad motaeb to fire at goal only for rafael to
dive full stretch and punch into safety
after the opening goal the champions continued to pile on the pressure
in the rd minute sayed moawad fired narrowly wide from inside the box while
moments later mozambique skipper manuel bucuane put the ball at the back of the
egyptian net only for the effort to be disallowed for offside
in the th minute substitute ahmed eid darted into the mozambique yard box
only for him to blast his final effort wide off the mark
mozambique fought back in search of an equaliser
substitute hagi blazed his shot from top of the box wide in the th minute but
as the clock ticked away it was obvious that they lacked the finishing prowess
to get on the score board and make better contest of this clash

us deeply concerned at arrests of coptic christians in egypt
beset by logistical challenges haiti relief presses on
washington jan afp
with many nations vying to get urgent relief into horror struck haiti after the
devastating earthquake us officials acknowledged saturday it was critical to
better coordinate the massive influx of aid
though the aid operation was picking up steam it was still not reaching many of
the survivors desperately scrambling for badly needed food and water four days
after the quake believed to have killed tens of thousands
some simply stopped waiting taking part in massive exodus out of the
devastated capital
as us troops tried to unblock the aid logjam donor nations were squabbling over
what haitian official described as major coordination problems at the
airport in port au prince now under us control and operating at its maximum
capacity of takeoffs or landings per day
french argentine peruvian and mexican flights were just some of many aircraft
filled with rescuers and supplies that were turned back at the country main
port of entry which has only one runway and where the control tower was
destroyed in the temblor
at this time there is gigantic traffic jam at port au prince airport
moreover the airport is functioning at very reduced capacity international
federation of red cross and red crescent societies operations coordinator
mauricio bustamante told afp
france sought to tamp down row after top minister said paris had formally
protested us handling of the aid flights after french aircraft carrying
field hospital was prevented from landing on friday
haitian authorities were not being informed when planes arrive so when they
land there is no one in charge said michel chancy haitian government
official who heads committee in charge of coordinating water and food
distribution
but challenges at the airport were only one part of the problem
once supplies arrived there were also major setbacks to delivering them to
those in need said tim callaghan senior regional adviser for the us agency
for international development usaid
the coordination piece in my opinion is huge and we must continue to work very
close ly with the international community donors and the government of haiti
to again identify priorities and get these supplies out as quickly as we can
in coordinated effort he told reporters
the effort is not just getting supplies in but it getting that out quickly
it communicating to everyone where it going it providing security in the
areas where the distributions are to ensure that relief items are provided in
timely fashion to assist the haitian people
the united states was participating in coordination meetings every morning with
other donors and non government organizations and food rations were being
delivered to distribution points
armed looters were meanwhile scavenging through the ruined capital of port au
prince insecure even in the best of times and now filled with the stench of
rotting corpses as anger and despair set in among exhausted survivors
there was no longer functioning police force
water purification tablets delivered late friday should be able to produce up to
liters gallons of water for distribution in containers
according to callaghan
more water supplies were being brought in from the dominican republic located
on the eastern side of hispaniola island which it shares with haiti
the united states was also providing daily rations individual
packages of calories of food for survivors until un backed world food
program plan swings into play
helicopters from the uss carl vinson aircraft carrier had already made trips
delivering water and ready to eat meals by midday saturday
the usns comfort us hospital ship was on its way to haiti from baltimore
maryland while five international clinics were operational
callaghan said us urban search and rescue teams and over firefighters had
fanned out to work around the clock to rescue people still trapped under the
rubble in massive effort he said would continue at least through sunday
they were being assisted by medical teams from countries
but in sign of the challenge it can take more than hours to free
single person from beneath slab of concrete the us teams had only managed
to recover haitians and americans by early saturday
national security council chief of staff denis mcdonough said tons
tonnes of relief supplies had arrived in haiti so far and that the us navy and
coast guard were looking for ways to reopen ports destroyed in tuesday massive
magnitude quake in order to ship in more materials
the united nations says fundraising for haiti has reached at least million
dollars
