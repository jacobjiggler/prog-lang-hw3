up us airliner on december as well as the november shooting rampage at
fort hood texas that killed people and wounded
anwar is moderate muslim he believes in the principals of islam he is not

coordination problems dog haiti relief effort
port au prince jan afp
desperate haitian quake survivors awaited vital supplies on saturday as
coordination problems hampered massive international aid effort and us troops
struggled to clear the logjam
four days after magnitude earthquake brought death and misery on an
unprecedented scale to the impoverished and dysfunctional caribbean nation aid
was trickling in but failing to reach some of those most in need
crammed onto overflowing buses or on foot thousands fled the flattened capital
where the putrid stench of decomposing bodies hung in the air and fears grew of
angry riots in the tense aftermath of tuesday quake
the streets smell of death said talulum saint fils who sold her jewelry for
one way bus tickets for her husband and their four children out of port au
prince
go to any place but away from this city she told afp there is no
assistance of any kind and our children simply cannot live like animals
senior haitian aid official michel chancy complained of major coordination
problems at the us operated airport in port au prince where the control tower
was felled by the quake and said that when planes land there is no one in
charge
french secretary of state for cooperation alain joyandet said he had lodged an
official complaint with the americans after plane from france carrying field
hospital was turned away
at this time there is gigantic traffic jam at port au prince airport
moreover the airport is functioning at very reduced capacity red cross

secretary of state hillary clinton became the highest ranking us official to
visit haiti since the quake and highlighted an urgent bid to clear logistics
hurdles and find creative ways to deliver aid
back in washington president barack obama rounded up the unlikely duo of george
bush and bill clinton for united aid pledge for haiti and said the united
states was doing its utmost to help
at this moment we re moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in
our history to save lives and to deliver relief that averts an even larger
catastrophe obama said alongside the former presidents at the white house
beset by host of problems including the lack of proper infrastructure in haiti
and government that admits it is no longer able to function the relief effort
has been slow to get into gear
the fate of whole towns and villages remains unclear
un team visited leogane west of the capital reporting back saturday that
percent of buildings there were damaged or destroyed and that police were
estimating up to dead in the one town alone
the united nations reported increasing numbers of haitians trying to cross the
border into neighboring dominican republic to the east as well as surge of
quake survivors fleeing the disaster zone in western haiti to northern cities
this is historic disaster we have never been confronted with such disaster
in the un memory it is like no other elisabeth byrs spokeswoman of the un
office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs told afp in geneva
despite the complaints about coordination significant amount of aid was
getting through either through the swamped airport at port au prince by road
from the dominican republic or from us helicopter flights
bustamente said the red cross had sent planeloads of material personnel and
humanitarian aid over the past four days while fleet of choppers on board
the giant aircraft carrier uss carl vinson made regular air drops
the united states was participating in coordination meetings every morning with
other donors and food rations were being delivered to distribution points
said tim callaghan senior regional adviser for the us agency for international
development usaid
but on the ground after isolated reports friday of machete wielding gangs
terrorizing survivors overnight there were growing signs of unease
barricades of burning tires rubble and human corpses blocked the main road out
of the haitian capital to nearby carrefour on saturday as residents called for
piles of decomposing bodies to be removed
they already took some bodies away but there are more many more said
charles weber year old voodoo priest in the crowd of at least three dozen
protesters surrounding the smoldering roadblock
haitian officials say at least people have been killed by the quake and
million left homeless
hope of finding new survivors faded fast but callaghan said us search and rescue
efforts would continue at least till sunday
we work with shovels picks and lot of heart said mexican rescue worker

abbas and meshaal have visited kuwait separately in the past two weeks and held
talks with emir sheikh sabah al ahmad al sabah who recently also received
egyptian president hosni mubarak
egypt has already twice postponed the planned signing of reconciliation

it

rugbyu clermont cardiff keep knockout hopes alive
paris jan afp
french side clermont and last season semi finalists cardiff stayed in the hunt
for places in the last eight of the european cup on saturday with deserved
victories
clermont outclassed previous pool three leaders ospreys in france to put
them second behind new leaders leicester who trounced italian side viadana
clermont need to beat viadana next weekend with an offensive bonus point to give
them chance of topping the table
cardiff humbled english side sale with two quickfire tries early in the
second half from richie rees and bradley davies settling the outcome
however despite giving cardiff chance of progressing the result most
benefited pool five leaders toulouse who can qualify if they beat harlequins in
toulouse on sunday and claim bonus point
their french top rivals biarritz did qualify on saturday as pool two winners
despite losing to gloucester
clermont went behind early on shortly after having try disallowed as irish
grand slam winning winger tommy bowe finished off delightful backline move for
his sixth try of the campaign keeping him top of the tryscorers list
however from then on it was all clermont and but for the nornally reliable
australian fly half brock james missing several kicks at goal no less than
three hit the posts they would have been out of sight by the time wales prop
adam jones was yellow carded with minutes remaining
the french side had scored try prior to that as aurelien rougerie collected
the ball from james up and under and passed to julien malzieu who raced into
the corner to touch down
the ospreys tried to reduce the deficit but instead conceded second try
shortly before the final whistle as napolioni nalaga profited from
misunderstanding between two of the welsh side players and cantered in to
score the try which james converted
clermont coach vern cotter was full of praise for his side opponents
have rarely seen team ospreys as well prepared as that they came with
very precise plan but appreciated the reaction of my team after the welsh
try

stade who have had disappointing season domestically are four points clear
of ulster with one match remaining but still face relatively tricky trip away
to edinburgh next weekend
ulster too must travel to bath and should they win and stade lose without
either side gaining bonus point to both finish on points it would be the
french side who top the table based on their head to head results ulster
having won the first meeting with stade victorious in the second
stade had looked to be cruising near the end of the first half after two jimmy
arias tries put them to the good
however immediately after arias second touchdown lionel beauxis attempt at
volleyed clearance from hugo southwell pass ended up being an airkick
the ball went over the stade try line and bath south african scrum half
michael claassens was on hand to beat the france fly half who was playing at
fullback to the ball and claim try which was duly converted
bath narrowed the deficit further two minutes into the second half when fijian
fly half nicky little landed penalty to make it and neither side were
able to add to their respective totals on bog like pitch in match played in
the pouring rain
we made the match lot more complicated than we should have done bemoaned
