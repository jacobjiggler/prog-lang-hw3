football myhill heroics frustrate spurs
london jan afp
string of saves from hull goalkeeper boaz myhill ensured tottenham had to
settle for goalless draw at white hart lane on saturday
the stalemate with one of the premier league strugglers did little to help
spurs hopes of securing champions league football but point was enough to
lift hull out of the bottom three for hours at least
first half played under torrential downpour offered little in the way of
entertainment until myhill produced the first of two superb double saves nine
minutes before the break
having kept out low drive from wilson palacios the goalkeeper recovered to
tip robbie keane rebound over the bar
myhill denied jermain defoe on the stroke of half time and spurs had good
penalty shout turned down just after the restart when andy dawson fell on the
ball after blocking volley from gareth bale
wales international myhill then surpassed his first half double stop by keeping
out luka modric volley before saving another keane follow up
tottenham boss harry redknapp replaced palacios with jermaine jenas and threw
peter crouch into the attack in place of keane
but hull were increasingly looking dangerous on the counter attack and the home
side had narrow escape when former spurs player nick barmby found the side
netting after being played in by stephen hunt
header from modric forced myhill into further saves with header and shot
that was headed towards the top corner
but spurs also lived dangerously at the back and only last ditch tackle from
michael dawson prevented the lively hunt from breaking clear
spurs had another penalty shout turned down when george boateng appeared to
block niko kranjcar drive with his hand and crouch had late header saved by
myhill but the home side could scarcely claim to have done enough to merit all
three points
football ferrara hits out at juve fans over stand closure
rome jan afp
juventus coach ciro ferrara criticised his club own fans following the italian
sporting justice decision to enforce partial stand closure on the misfiring
turin giants
juve south stand at the stadio olimpico will be closed for next weekend
match at home to roma after fans chanted racial slurs against inter milan
forward mario balotelli an italian of ghanaian origin during wednesday
coppa italia victory over napoli
it was the third time this season that fans had chanted such slogans about the
teenager
and ferrara whose job is under scrutiny after six defeats in juve last nine
matches hit out at italian fans in general
against every type of racism and violence unfortunately we live in
football culture related to results if you win all goes well if you don you
have problems said ferrara whose side visit chievo on sunday
that how it works for the team with regard to the fans unfortunately we are
backward they think more about offending their opponents than supporting their
own team
in england there are teams that get relegated and the players go to the stands
to get standing ovation from the fans when we arrive at that we ll have taken
great step forwards
playing without one stand around people out of stadium that holds less
than against roma is defeat for everyone
the club has done everything to stop this kind of behaviour from the fans but
italian rules penalise the club
despite wednesday win against second string napoli in the cup ferrara
insisted it was too early to start believing his team has turned corner
having begun the season harbouring hopes of winning the title they now find
themselves bogged down in the battle for champions league football next season
they are third points behind leaders inter milan but with four teams within
just one victory of them
we have to concentrate on ourselves but also the group of teams around us
said ferrara
it too early to say that we re back after that win over napoli ve asked
the team to be humble and careful
ferrara also revealed that new loan signing michele paolucci could even begin
sunday match
paolucci began his career with juve youth team before moving on to ascoli
udinese atalanta and catania
he started this season with siena and despite playing only bit part role he is
back with the turin giants and filling in for injured forwards david trezeguet
and vincenzo iaquinta

the challenges in haiti are immense but there lot of devoted people
leading the relief effort he said
the most effective way for americans to help the people of haiti is to

new egypt brotherhood chief signals shift from politics
cairo jan afp
mohammed badie who was chosen on saturday as the new head of egypt opposition
muslim brotherhood is former radical who has served time in jail but rejects
violence and advocates gradual reform
we believe in incremental reform and that takes place in peaceful and
constitutional way badie told cairo news conference after his predecessor
mohammed akef announced that he had been chosen by consensus for the top job
we reject violence and denounce it in all its forms said badie with salt
and pepper beard and wearing dark suit and tie
veterinary professor badie has been responsible for ideological education for
the brotherhood group banned in egypt even though it has controlled fifth
of the seats in parliament since the last general election in
badie is the group eighth leader since its foundation in and he will
head the organisation for the next six years
he is seen by analysts as conservative whose election signals shift away for
the brotherhood from politics towards religion education and social work
born in in the nile delta town of mahalla el kubra badie was jailed for
nine years in the after being accused of membership of brotherhood
paramilitary cell that allegedly planned to overthrow the government
thousands of islamists were also imprisoned at the time and influential radical
islamist thinker sayyid qutb was executed
badie later became responsible for ideological education in the brotherhood
some reformists have been wary of him because of his sympathies towards qutb
who advocated armed struggle against secular muslim governments
he was arrested again in and sentenced to another nine years by military
tribunal but served only four
diaa rashwan an expert on political islam said badie was sympathetic towards
qutb as were many in the conservative camp leadership
but he was not one of the most extremist elements he said adding that badie
is not involved in public work
he is part of the ideological activity there will be diminishment of public
work and more emphasis on the ideological work under his tenure
badie is one of the sons of the organisation they were introduced to what
was military organisation that preached revolution said abdel moneim mahmud
journalist associated with the group reformist wing
to be realistic the organisation never actually did anything but at the end
of the day it was the door through which they entered the brotherhood and they
believed in it he said
badie election came after bitter dispute between conservatives in the group
who place the emphasis on strengthening the organisation and ideological
outreach and reformists advocating more active public role
akef resigned last year before the end of his term in office in protest after
conservative members of the brotherhood politburo opposed promotion for essam
erian who is associated with the group reformist wing
conservatives within the brotherhood may have found leader after their own
heart in badie as they try to promote social and educational programmes the
new leader strong points rather than political activity analysts say
football man wigan earn crucial win at wolves
wolverhampton england jan afp
wigan claimed crucial win over relegation rivals wolverhampton thanks to
goals from james mccarthy and charles zogbia at molineux on saturday
roberto martinez side missed first half penalty when marcus hahnemann saved
hugo rodallega effort after wolves defender richard stearman was sent off for
bringing down mccarthy
but scottish teenager mccarthy marked his first premier league start with goal
on the hour
wigan were also reduced to men when hendry thomas was sent off for two
bookings but french star zogbia put the result beyond doubt late on
the latics win lifted them four points clear of the relegation zone while
wolves remain one point above the bottom three
the hosts should have been ahead in the th minute when sylvan ebanks blake
latched onto pass from nenad milijas
however the former manchester united trainee prodded his shot tamely wide with
just chris kirkland to beat
rodallega was posing all manner of problems for the wolves defence and he hit
the post with fierce long range drive
yet rodallega must have feared it wasn going to be his day in first half
stoppage time
stearman gave away penalty when he tugged mccarthy shirt and was dismissed
for second bookable offence
but hahnemann saved rodallega spot kick and then paul scharner sent the
rebound wide
hahnemann came to wolves rescue again when he was perfectly positioned to keep
out fierce shot from rodallega
but the american was finally beaten on the hour zogbia shrugged off stephen
ward tackle and squared to rodallega who once again was denied by hahnemann
at close range the rebound fell to mccarthy and he lashed home
wigan task was made harder when thomas committed his second bookable offence
by fouling stephen ward in the th minute
but they made the points safe in the rd minute when rodallega shrugged off
michael mancienne challenge and teed up zogbia who cut in from the right
before shooting into the corner of the net
football rangers open nine point lead over celtic
glasgow jan afp
rangers extended their lead at the top of the scottish premier league to nine
points on saturday after nacho novo secured win over hamilton while celtic
were held by basement side falkirk
walter smith side laboured for long periods at new douglas park before spanish
star novo finally broke the deadlock with minutes left
rangers captain david weir said we never played well enough in the first half
but thought in the second half we improved and delighted for nacho
getting the goal
smith made three changes to the side held to draw by hamilton in the
scottish cup last sunday
kenny miller and lee mcculloch were both suspended and kris boyd was sidelined
after undergoing groin surgery with novo kevin thomson and maurice edu coming
in
celtic fell behind when the bairns took th minute lead after some poor
defending allowed carl finnigan to rifle shot past artur boruc
the hoops drew level through georgios samaras just before the break and despite
piling on the pressure in the second half falkirk held on for their first point
at celtic park since
celtic will feel aggrieved they weren awarded second half penalty with two
strong appeals against falkirk side that also held the glasgow giants to
draw earlier in the season
celtic manager tony mowbray made five changes to his team allowing south korean
ki sung yeung to make his debut
stephen mcmanus was partnered by darren dea after he completed his loan spell
with reading
bottom club falkirk made strong start and pedro miguel pele header from
corner in the third minute had to be cleared off the line by andreas hinkel
run from aiden mcgeady almost resulted in the opener after ten minutes but his
shot from the edge of the box flew just wide of robert olejnik post
marc antoine fortune came close with powerful header after he rose highest in
the box to connect with ki floated free kick
but poor defending allowed falkirk to take th minute lead
long ball was knocked on by enoch showunmi to finnigan at the edge of the box
and after brushing off dea challenge he calmly slotted his left foot shot
past boruc
the polish keeper kept his team in it minutes later when he pulled off superb
save low to his left to stop ryan flynn shot from yards going in just
as it looked falkirk would take the lead into the break celtic drew level
through samaras in the th minute
marc crosas slipped pass to him down the left channel and the greek striker
rifled an angled shot past olejnik from just inside the box
china captain zheng zhi should have done better when he sent his header off
target from hinkel cross while olejnik then had to be at his best to produce
fingertip save to keep out ki superb free kick from yards out
celtic were appealing for penalty when zheng overhead kick appeared to hit
falkirk defender arm in the box but the referee waved away their protests
falkirk won free kick in dangerous position at the edge of the box but
substitute jack compton sent his effort well over the bar
the hoops were again screaming for penalty when fortune went down under the
challenge from brian mclean but his appeals were ignored
elsewhere craig brown got his first win as interim manager of motherwell as they
defeated jimmy calderwood kilmarnock dundee united beat hibernian and
hearts also won against st mirren

football united ensure losing start for laws
manchester england jan afp
dimitar berbatov wayne rooney and mame biram diouf scored second half goals to
earn manchester united win over burnley that was not quite as
straightforward as the scoreline suggests
the clarets who had new manager brian laws in charge for the first time proved
tricky opponents despite having picked up just one point away from home all
season
berbatov finally broke down their resistance just after the hour and rooney made
the game safe with his th goal of the season
new signing diouf added third his first for the club in added time but it
was far from comfortable afternoon for the champions
steven fletcher passed up golden chance for the clarets to take shock lead
in the seventh minute
the visitors broke from nani corner ex united man chris eagles released
david nugent and his pass set fletcher clean through on goal only for the
scotland international to drill wide
nani back after month out with ankle trouble continued his poor form in
front of goal with an air shot at luis valencia cross before berbatov shot
way off target
up against the ageing gary neville eagles was causing all sorts of problems by
cutting in from the left and his lofted pass just had too much on it for nugent
with the on loan portsmouth striker poised to strike
but finally there was some quality from nani as the portugese slipped inside and
hit bobbling drive that was held by burnley goalkeeper brian jensen
neville squeezed pass through to nani and the winger lifted cross back in
but rooney header did not have the power to trouble jensen
united were dominating possession and after stroking it around neville lofted
the ball in but rooney headed straight at jensen
valencia always looked united best option and when he was picked out once
again by rooney he drilled in low cross that was stabbed at goal by berbatov
only to be deflected wide
and valencia showed united mounting frustration when he clattered into
fletcher
stephen jordan was continuing to give valencia far too much space and the
ecuador winger cross flew over the area allowing nani to cross back in for
berbatov but the bulgarian failed to hit the target
another valencia cross was glanced wide by paul scholes as he searched for his
th premier league goal
jensen was still leading charmed life and after united finally worked some
room on the edge of the area rooney clipped shot wide of goal while another
quick break down the right saw valencia cross in and nani overhead kick
deflected wide
after the restart nani hit hopeful long range drive straight at jensen and
after patrice evra wriggled out of two challenges rooney sliced his shot well
over the bar
but nani even surpassed that that with horrible shank that almost went out for
burnley throw
berbatov went much closer when he received return pass from valencia and
juggled the ball past david edgar stabbing shot off the outside of the post
nugent should have given the visitors shock lead when he was played through by
eagles but the one time england striker sliced wide despite out pacing neville
united finally made the breakthrough midway through the second period when
rooney slipped pass through for berbatov and the bulgarian lifted calm shot
past jensen
rooney doubled the lead when berbatov shot was blocked by jensen and the
england forward held off michael duff challenge to roll into the corner
steve thompson could have grabbed consolation for burnley in the closing
stages but his header came back off the post before diouf headed in united
third from valencia huge clearance
football chelsea send sunderland packing and warning to rivals
london jan afp
carlo ancelotti chelsea side laid down an impressive marker in the premier
league title race with an emphatic victory over sunderland at stamford
bridge on saturday
nicolas anelka and frank lampard led the way with two goals each with florent
malouda ashley cole and michael ballack completing the rout
bolo zenden and darren bent claimed sunderland consolations but steve
bruce men will count themselves lucky to have left west london with only
five goal deficit after hopelessly one sided game that showcased chelsea
impressive strengths
ancelotti reflected this week on the failure of chelsea main rivals in the
title race to make the most of his side recent slips and declared himself to
be lucky coach
that may be the case but it quickly became clear that no luck would be needed
to dismiss the threat of patched up sunderland side that had been ravaged by
injuries
with four central defenders missing bruce was forced to press lorik cana into
action as an emergency centre back and the albanian midfielder looked hopelessly
out of place
the pattern for the game was set after just two minutes when florent malouda
released joe cole only for the england midfielder to scuff his shot hardly the
best way for player locked in contract negotiations to start the game
fortunately for cole his team mates were in more ruthless mood and that miss
was quickly forgotten when anelka got the scoring underway just six minutes
later
anelka was back in the side after recovering from hamstring injury and ready
