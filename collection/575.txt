to assume responsibility for leading the attack in the absence of didier drogba
absent on international duty with ivory coast
and he wasted no time in rising to the challenge getting in behind the
sunderland defence to collect ballack superb threaded pass and round keeper
marton fulop before finishing into an empty net
ten minutes later the game was effectively over when malouda another chelsea
player anxious to prove point and convince ancelotti he should get more starts
shrugged off challenge near the halfway line and ran at the heart of the
back pedalling visitors defence
the frenchman was invited to run unchallenged into the area where he produced
right foot finish that gave fulop no chance
gaps were appearing all over the pitch and it was clear that chelsea and
ashley cole in particular were beginning to enjoy themselves
the england left back was able to attack sunderland full back phil bardsley at
will and he deservedly claimed the nd minute third after latching onto john
terry chipped through ball before clipping the ball calmly over fulop
it was all about damage limitation for sunderland but they couldn even manage
that effectively and twelve minutes later chelsea made it four through lampard
once again ashley cole was involved this time serving up teasing cross that
lampard volleyed home from six yards out
surprisingly chelsea didn add to their tally before the break although it took
them just seven minutes of the second half to rediscover their scoring touch
through ballack who headed home unmarked from joe cole cross
sunderland at least managed to restore small amount of pride when zenden
scored his first goal for the club firing home right footed from kenwyne
jones knock down in the th minute
but anelka second of the afternoon put them back in their place nine minutes
later
lampard headed home from anelka cross in the last minute of normal time
before bent scrambled second sunderland goal in added time

football united ensure losing start for laws
manchester england jan afp
dimitar berbatov wayne rooney and mame biram diouf scored second half goals to
earn manchester united win over burnley that was not quite as
straightforward as the scoreline suggests
the clarets who had new manager brian laws in charge for the first time proved
tricky opponents despite having picked up just one point away from home all
season
berbatov finally broke down their resistance just after the hour and rooney made
the game safe with his th goal of the season
new signing diouf added third his first for the club in added time but it
was far from comfortable afternoon for the champions
steven fletcher passed up golden chance for the clarets to take shock lead
in the seventh minute
the visitors broke from nani corner ex united man chris eagles released
david nugent and his pass set fletcher clean through on goal only for the
scotland international to drill wide
nani back after month out with ankle trouble continued his poor form in
front of goal with an air shot at luis valencia cross before berbatov shot
way off target
up against the ageing gary neville eagles was causing all sorts of problems by
cutting in from the left and his lofted pass just had too much on it for nugent
with the on loan portsmouth striker poised to strike
but finally there was some quality from nani as the portugese slipped inside and
hit bobbling drive that was held by burnley goalkeeper brian jensen
neville squeezed pass through to nani and the winger lifted cross back in
but rooney header did not have the power to trouble jensen
united were dominating possession and after stroking it around neville lofted
the ball in but rooney headed straight at jensen
valencia always looked united best option and when he was picked out once
again by rooney he drilled in low cross that was stabbed at goal by berbatov
only to be deflected wide
and valencia showed united mounting frustration when he clattered into
fletcher
stephen jordan was continuing to give valencia far too much space and the
ecuador winger cross flew over the area allowing nani to cross back in for
berbatov but the bulgarian failed to hit the target
another valencia cross was glanced wide by paul scholes as he searched for his
th premier league goal
jensen was still leading charmed life and after united finally worked some
room on the edge of the area rooney clipped shot wide of goal while another
quick break down the right saw valencia cross in and nani overhead kick
deflected wide
after the restart nani hit hopeful long range drive straight at jensen and
after patrice evra wriggled out of two challenges rooney sliced his shot well
over the bar
but nani even surpassed that that with horrible shank that almost went out for
burnley throw
berbatov went much closer when he received return pass from valencia and
juggled the ball past david edgar stabbing shot off the outside of the post
nugent should have given the visitors shock lead when he was played through by
eagles but the one time england striker sliced wide despite out pacing neville
united finally made the breakthrough midway through the second period when
rooney slipped pass through for berbatov and the bulgarian lifted calm shot
past jensen
rooney doubled the lead when berbatov shot was blocked by jensen and the
england forward held off michael duff challenge to roll into the corner
steve thompson could have grabbed consolation for burnley in the closing
stages but his header came back off the post before diouf headed in united
third from valencia huge clearance

darfur rebels report air artillery attacks by sudan forces
khartoum jan afp
sudanese warplanes and artillery pounded insurgents in the troubled western
region of darfur on saturday said rebel spokesman whose group has refused to
attend upcoming peace talks in qatar
the army attacked our positions said ibrahim al hillu commander and

hillu rebel faction
he said government forces were attacking from three directions kutum abdel
shakur and al dor and concentrating fire on the village of frog which hosts
popular open air market on saturdays
there was no immediate confirmation of the attack from the government and un
peacekeepers said they were investigating the report
we are trying to confirm this information noureddin mezni spokesman for the
unamid un african union peacekeepers told afp
local sources said that clashes last week between the military and the same
rebels in jebel marra fertile plain in central darfur forced humanitarian
workers to evacuate
sla abdel wahid is one of the most powerful factions within the deeply divided
darfur rebellion the conflict that erupted in initially pitted two rebel
groups against the government and its arab militia allies
both the rebels and the pro government militias have since splintered into an
array of factions including the also powerful justice and equality movement
jem which is attending next week peace talks in the qatari capital doha
the united nations says up to people have died from the combined effects
of war famine and disease in darfur and that another million have fled
their homes

the aim of holding an eventual peace conference on darfur

egypt muslim brotherhood names conservative as new leader
cairo jan afp
egypt main opposition group the muslim brotherhood named conservative
mohammed badie as its new leader on saturday in move analysts said signals
switch to less active role in politics
badie veterinary professor at southern university was chosen by consensus
by members of the consultative council his predecessor mohammed akef told
press conference in cairo
the brotherhood is officially banned but controls fifth of seats in the
egyptian parliament after it ran independent candidates in the last general
election in
badie told reporters that the brotherhood rejected violence and aimed to achieve
gradual reforms
we believe in incremental reform and that takes places in peaceful and
constitutional way we reject violence and denounce it in all its forms the
new leader said
the group has affiliates in other muslim states some with official status and
the egyptian brotherhood leader is in theory also the chief of these though in
practice groups in other countries are autonomous
but badie the movement eighth supreme guide since it was founded in may
be more divisive figure than his predecessor and his appointment signals
return to less high profile public role
it comes after bitter dispute between conservatives in the group who place
the emphasis on strengthening the organisation and ideological outreach and
reformists advocating more active public role
akef resigned last year before the end of his term in office after conservatives
blocked the promotion of essam erian associated with the group reformist
wing to the politburo in subsequent politburo elections the conservatives won
all the seats but one occupied by erian
born in in the nile delta town of mahalla el kubra badie was jailed for
nine years in the after being accused of membership in brotherhood
paramilitary cell that allegedly planned the overthrow of the government
thousands of islamists were also imprisoned at the time and influential radical
islamist thinker sayyid qutb was executed
badie later became responsible for ideological education in the group some of
the reformists have been wary of him because of his sympathies with qutb who
advocated armed struggle to impose islamic law
he was arrested again in and sentenced to another nine years by military
tribunal but served only four
badie is one of the sons of the organisation they were introduced to what
was military organisation that preached revolution said abdel moneim mahmud
journalist associated with the group reformist wing
to be realistic the organisation never actually did anything but at the end
of the day it was the door through which they entered the brotherhood and they
believed in it he said
the brotherhood conservative wing has been seen to consolidate its control in
recent politburo elections with the group deputy chief mohammed habib and
reformist leader abdel moneim abul futuh losing their seats
analysts say the new leadership team and campaign of arrests by police are
likely to encourage shift away from public life the government has also
passed laws that make it harder to contest the parliament election
there are two causes for the regression of political work the first is intense
government pressures and the constitutional changes made on participation in
elections said diaa rashwan an expert on political islam
the other factor is that badie is not involved in public work he is part of
the ideological work
football magnificent seven boosts chelsea title push
london jan afp
chelsea reasserted their credentials as premier league title favourites with
superb demolition of sunderland on saturday
manchester united who have played game more than the leaders remained one
point off the pace after win over burnley at old trafford
but it was another frustrating day for liverpool who conceded last minute
equaliser at stoke which further dents their chances of top four finish and
return to the champions league next season
chelsea were in irresistible form at stamford bridge carlo ancelotti men
might have been two goals in front by the time nicolas anelka put them ahead in
the seventh minute
florent malouda added second with solo run and shot ashley cole provided an
equally fine third and frank lampard ensured sunderland were out for the count
with only minutes gone
germany captain michael ballack made it five after the restart before boudewijn
zenden pulled one back for sunderland
anelka quickly replied and lampard also claimed second goal of the afternoon
before darren bent stoppage time strike ensured sunderland avoided equalling
their heaviest premier league defeat
there were no such fireworks at old trafford where the manchester united
faithful had to wait until the th minute before dimitar berbatov broke
burnley resistance
wayne rooney th goal of the season and substitute mame biram diouf first
for the club made sure that brian laws first match in charge of burnley ended
in defeat
second half goal from sotirios kyrgiakos had looked like it would be enough to
ease the pressure on liverpool manager rafael benitez following the club fa
cup exit to championship side reading earlier in the week
but the defensive frailty that has hampered liverpool throughout the campaign
was exposed again in the th minute when robert huth scrambled in an equaliser
after the visitors had failed to clear corner
having been denied what appeared to be clear penalty in the first half
liverpool suffered further frustration when dirk kuyt headed against the post in
the fifth minute of injury time
it feels like defeat admitted kuyt we aren playing the best football at
the moment but thought we fought really hard for this result and to concede
in the last minute and even miss great chance in the last minute is
unbelievable
the draw left liverpool languishing in seventh place four points adrift of
fourth placed tottenham who moved above manchester city on goal difference
after goalless draw at home to hull
city had the chance to move back above spurs when they faced everton at goodison
park later in the day
