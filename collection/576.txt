pro russia politician set to sweep ukraine polls
kiev jan afp
pro russia politician viktor yanukovich was on course saturday to sweep the
first round of ukraine presidential polls five years after vote rigging by
his supporters sparked the orange revolution
polls showed yanukovich with clear lead going into sunday elections albeit
without the majority required to avoid second round run off against his main
challenger the glamorous prime minister yulia tymoshenko
the orange revolution protests of late swept ukraine old order from power
and created hopes of new era of prosperity and european integration for the
country of million people bridging the eu and russia
but amid grave public disillusionment after five years of botched reform and
political stalemate the revolution hero pro western president viktor
yushchenko is set to be bundled out in the first round
with tymoshenko making much of her warm ties with russia strongman prime
minister vladimir putin the outcome of the february run off is already being
seen as good news for the kremlin which cut off all business with yushchenko
after frenetic campaign that saw the main protagonists exchange stinging
insults saturday was an official day of calm with all campaigning banned and
campaign posters removed from the streets
yanukovich prayed at kiev millennium old caves monastery one of the most
revered sites of orthodox christianity declaring afterwards that he had asked
for god help and salvation
all the main candidates spent the final hours of legal campaigning friday
exchanging bitter insults in separate appearances on television talkshows
tymoshenko attacked yanukovich intellectual capabilities saying he was unable
to distinguish austria from australia he just thinks that kangaroos live in
both of them she sniped
yanukovich spat back with another personal attack on the prime minister saying
that while whims beautify woman it not so in this case
yushchenko meanwhile declared that if either of the two others won we can say
goodbye to our democracy our independence and our sovereignty
yanukovich should win around percent of the vote in the first round and
tymoshenko percent according to the latest polls by the kiev international
institute of sociology
but analysts believe the image conscious prime minister famed for her
trademark hair braid can still make up ground in the run off
third place is expected to go to businessman sergiy tigipko who appears to have
made late surge and is given an outside chance of springing first round
upset
with election fraud still major concern in ukraine the authorities in the
eastern city of donetsk raised alarm over the sudden arrival of almost
georgians in the city who they said were not accredited as observers
the head of donetsk city council nikolai levchenko said there was evidence that
the georgians all male and well built were aiming to carry out
violations in favour of tymoshenko
the georgian presidency meanwhile denied that tbilisi was favouring any
candidate
yushchenko won the presidency in re run election in december ordered by
the courts after tens of thousands took to the streets to accuse yanukovich of
vote rigging in the original polls that he won
yushchenko and tymoshenko were comrades in arms in the orange revolution but
later became sworn enemies their relationship poisoned by perennial power
struggle and mutual accusations of criminal wrongdoing
since yanukovich has sought to reinvent himself with the help of western
pr strategists and to show he is not servant of the kremlin but defender of
ukrainian interests
he has also sought more support in the country ukrainian speaking west
traditionally the heartland of tymoshenko and yushchenko supporters while
holding on to his powerbase in the russian speaking east
egypt security court to try suspects in copt killings
cairo jan afp
three muslims accused of gunning down six egyptian christians on the coptic
christmas eve will stand trial before an emergency security court the state
prosecutor said on saturday
abdel magid mahmud said in statement that the three men were charged with
premeditated murder aimed at harming national interests
the suspects were arrested day after the six copts and muslim policeman were
shot dead along stretch of road with churches and shopping centre in the
southern village of nagaa hammadi
the drive by shooting took place after worshippers emerged from midnight mass
before christmas marked by copts and other orthodox communities across the
world on january
the killings which were condemned by pope benedict xvi sparked outrage among
the country copts who make up nearly percent of egypt million people
and led to clashes with police
number of muslim and coptic homes and stores were attacked and burnt in the
ensuing violence
italian foreign minister franco frattini on visit to cairo on saturday
expressed satisfaction at the quick reaction of the egyptian authorities and
the arrests of suspects in the killings
last week he condemned the violence against copts as horrific and outrageous
and said he would discuss the protection of the copt community with egyptian
foreign minister ahmed abul gheit in cairo
the international community cannot remain indifferent and must never lower its
guard in the face of religious intolerance which is serious violation of
basic human rights frattini said on january
after their meeting abul gheit insisted there are no clouds between italy and
egypt despite frattini previous harsh criticism
sectarian clashes occur regularly in egypt particularly in the rural south but
this month attack was the bloodiest since copts died in clashes in
egyptian human rights activist hafez abu saada said the trial would be the first
conducted by state security court over sectarian attack such courts allow
no right of appeal
it message of reassurance to the copts and to affirm the government
concern towards this case he said
copts complain of discrimination in muslim majority egypt they are permitted to
build churches only after they get presidential permission and must apply to
their governor to renovate churches
the prosecutor did not announce date for the trial
meanwhile police released some activists and bloggers who went to nagaa
hammadi to express their solidarity with the families of the shooting victims
but they will still face charges blogger said
wael abbas prominent opposition blogger among those arrested said they were
charged with belonging to an illegal organisation and trying to harm national
unity among several other charges

football milan coach leonardo shuts out derby title thoughts
rome jan afp
ac milan coach leonardo on saturday insisted he is not thinking about either
next weekend derby or the serie title
lot of expectation surrounds the derby with the two milan teams holding the
top two positions in the league and milan really needing to win to fire some
life back into the title race
they sit eight points behind inter but with game in hand
things hotted up this week as well as fixture row broke out following the
italian football league decision to schedule two cup matches on successive
days at the san siro with inter playing hours after milan
but leonardo wants his team to concentrate on matters at hand with siena the
visitors on sunday
we re not thinking about the derby we re preparing one match at time and
that the great strength of this team said the coach
we haven forgotten what we ve done over the last six months but now the team
is happy and we want to show some consistency
milan have certainly developed that over the course of the season although
home defeat to palermo just before christmas served as warning against further
complacency
having started the season poorly scoring only six goals in their opening nine
matches milan have more than matched inter since
but siena showed week ago that despite being bottom of the league they can be
dangerous and they led inter at the san siro with two minutes to play before
collapsing to defeat
