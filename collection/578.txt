quake sparks massive exodus from haitian capital
port au prince jan afp
standing at bus station next to her husband and four children talulum saint
fils is so determined to get as far away from the haitian capital as possible
she has sold her family jewelry for one way tickets
go to any place but away from this city she repeats again and again
many haitians share her scathing view of port au prince often referred now as
hell after being massively destroyed by tuesday magnitude earthquake
thousands of residents have fled the city in recent days saying they were tired
of sleeping in the street afraid of being robbed by ruthless gangs or simply
fearful that new powerful aftershocks might destroy buildings that still remain
standing
if the city dwellers have relatives in the country they gather what left of
their personal belongings and hit the road in the hope of waiting out the
catastrophe in parts of haiti that have suffered less damage
the streets smell of death saint fils goes on in distress there is no
assistance of any kind and our children simply cannot live like animals
to buy one way tickets to fodernerg small city three hours away from the
capital the family had to sell jewelry to come up with gourdes dollars
twice the usual fare
like to rebuild our house but where will we get the money to do it she
asks
when the bus comes it is packed and those who could not squeeze themselves on
it cannot hide their anger but bus operators just shake their heads
we carry twice as many passengers as usual and we have doubled the fare because
there is no gasoline and no security in the city argues jaino nony owner of
several buses
but that the right price for getting out of hell
aanoz richard year old baker who has become homeless after the quake is
livid because his savings were not enough to pay the fare
look this is my house and this is my bed now he says pointing in despair
toward the street
another bus packed with passengers and their belongings leaves the station
taking to distant city family who have spent hours waiting for any
available transportation and negotiating the fare
they say the government is receiving millions of dollars in aid but we have
not seen cent laments islaine mother of three children we and our
children have been left in the street and we have no other option but to leave
even though we have spent our whole lives here
she says she would like to return to port au prince one day but does not know
if that will be possible
the exodus is now visibly affecting the haitian capital as some of the hardest
hit neighborhoods look empty
woman who identified herself as braubrin high school teacher said she felt
fortunate to be alive because the earthquake had completely destroyed her house
but she does not hide her disappointment in the haitian government
the haitian governments have never done anything for the people braubrin
says we are absolutely dependant of other countries but we can just sit
here surrounded by dead bodies and wait for somebody to come and rescue us
half empty bus from the province pulls into the station bringing in farmer
alix bonfils who came to look for his missing brothers
we have not heard from them since the quake and cannot bear this uncertainty
any longer says bonfils
he looks at the devastation around him and says he cannot believe his eyes
we knew it was serious he throws up his hands but one really cannot realize
how serious before seeing it with his own eyes
according to un officials an estimated people have been left homeless
by the devastating earthquake with one in homes in the capital destroyed
high proportion of the haitian capital three million people were saturday
still without access to food water shelter and electricity

cricket england in trouble after proteas strike three times
johannesburg jan afp
south africa fast bowlers struck three times in england second innings as
the home team pushed for series levelling victory on the third day of the
fourth and final test at the wanderers stadium on saturday
england were reeling at for three when bad light stopped play still runs
short of avoiding an innings defeat
morne morkel had alastair cook caught at first slip by graeme smith in the
fourth over and dale steyn produced superb delivery which swung away late and
caused jonathan trott to edge catch to ab de villiers at third slip
the umpires took the players off for bad light with the total on for two but
they were soon back for another half hour of play during which new cap wayne
parnell trapped england captain andrew strauss leg before wicket shortly before
the day third and final stoppage
south africa earlier declared after piling up for seven in their first
innings
de villiers and mark boucher shared an attacking century partnership with de
villiers riding his luck to make before thunderstorm hit the ground
minutes after lunch
but the storm passed and south africa were able to take giant strides towards
squaring series they trail
boucher hit sparkling off balls falling short of his sixth test
century when he top edged sweep against off spinner graeme swann and was
caught at deep backward square leg
it was the second time in the innings that swann had taken wicket with the
first ball of spell and the th time in as many test matches that he had
struck in the first over of spell
but swann was out of luck when he twice won appeals against de villiers from
umpire tony hill only for the decisions to be overturned on review
to add to england miseries with the review system they wasted review when
swann sought leg before wicket decision against boucher then saw de villiers
get away with what seemed clear inside edge to wicketkeeper matt prior off
ryan sidebottom
because england had used up both their reviews including the controversial
review of the decision that saw graeme smith escape dismissal on friday they
could not seek to get steve davis not out decision reversed
england used up one of their second innings batting reviews when strauss tried
unsuccessfully to challenge hill lbw decision shortly before play ended for
the day
de villiers and boucher put on for the sixth wicket scoring at four runs an
over after three wickets fell early in the day
while de villiers was not entirely convincing boucher was in excellent form as
he made his third half century of the series
only two runs had been added when overnight batsmen hashim amla and jacques
kallis were dismissed in successive overs to be followed by jp duminy
amla edged the tenth ball of the day from stuart broad for prior to take
diving catch kallis followed in the next over when ball from ryan sidebottom
lifted more sharply than expected and an attempted pull looped to gully where
james anderson dived to hold good catch
duminy troubles against swann continued when he beaten by the flight and sharp
spin to edge the off spinner first ball of the day to slip it was the third
time in the series he had been out to swann in similar circumstances twice
caught at slip and once by the wicketkeeper
at that stage south africa were only runs ahead and with new ball due
within seven overs england appeared to have clawed their way back into the
match
but de villiers and boucher restored south africa dominance before de villiers
mistimed pull against broad and was caught at midwicket

pakistani taliban leader says he is alive after us strike
peshawar pakistan jan afp
pakistan taliban leader hakimullah mehsud released new audio recording
saturday saying he was alive and well after reports emerged that he was killed
in us bombing raid
missiles fired from an unmanned us aircraft killed at least islamist
insurgents at training camp in pakistan lawless northwest tribal belt on
thursday and security officials said mehsud may have been among the dead
the recording comes day after the taliban released similar audio file in
which mehsud said he was alive but did not mention the specific strike thursday
apparently targeting him and that triggered rumours of his death
today on the th of january am saying it again am alive am ok
am not injured when the drone strike took place was not present in the
area at that time mehsud said
this is propaganda of the kafirs unbelievers they want to weaken us through
this propaganda he added
reporters familiar with mehsud said the voice appeared to be his
the tehreek taliban pakistan ttp movement he commands had already repeatedly
denied his demise while the government the military and us officials said only
that they were looking into the reports
hakimullah mehsud assumed leadership of the group blamed for the deaths of
thousands of people in attacks across pakistan after his predecessor baitullah
mehsud was killed in us drone strike in august last year
the ttp denied baitullah mehsud death for weeks apparently amid fierce
infighting over his successor
the us bombing raid thursday hit in remote and mountainous area between the
districts of north and south waziristan and was the latest in volley of
strikes by unmanned us planes to pummel the region bordering afghanistan
on friday two us drone strikes killed militants in north waziristan
bastion of al qaeda fighters the taliban and the haqqani network which launches
attacks on us and nato troops in neighbouring afghanistan
more than people have been killed in about us drone strikes in pakistan
since august with surge in under us president barack obama nine
drone strikes have hit the tribal northwest this month alone
the bombings fuel anti american sentiment in muslim pakistan and the ttp
repeatedly vow to avenge the raids
if the drone attacks continue the ttp will not be responsible for any
dangerous steps in future the government of pakistan will be responsible
mehsud said in saturday recording
while washington is pressing islamabad to tackle militants who use its soil to
launch attacks in neighbouring afghanistan pakistan armed forces last year
carried out multiple assaults on ttp strongholds across the tribal belt
despite the offensives attacks blamed on the ttp show no sign of abating with
bombings increasingly hitting civilians on january more than people were
killed in suicide blast at volleyball game in northwest town
then on january the ttp chief appeared in video clip alongside jordanian
who blew himself up on us military base in afghanistan last month killing
seven cia agents and his jordanian handler
the bomber claimed the attack was to avenge the death of baitullah mehsud
richard holbrooke washington special representative to afghanistan and
pakistan said earlier that the us did not know if ttp chief hakimullah mehsud
was dead but condemned the islamist extremists
if he is still alive he is one of the worst people on earth one of the most
vicious holbrooke told reporters in kabul

yemen confirms qaeda chiefs deaths captures militants
sanaa jan afp
yemen confirmed on saturday the deaths of six senior al qaeda figures in an air
strike day earlier while continuing its crackdown on the group by arresting
three suspected militants
there had been conflicting reports on friday about the identities of those
killed when warplane targeted three vehicle convoy and whether any of the
eight people on the ground had escaped
in statement on its website the interior ministry said al qaeda in the
arabian peninsula aqap military boss qassem al rimi died when missile hit
his vehicle in the eastern part of saada province
also killed were ayed al shabwani ammar al waili saleh al tais egyptian
ibrahim mohammed saleh al banna and an unidentified sixth person the ministry
said
late on friday after initially having said waili and tais had been killed
senior official said they had escaped
the ministry website did not refer to the fate of the remaining two people
rimi was among people who had made daring escape from state security
prison in sanaa in february that left the yemeni government red faced and
he was on list of wanted suspects
banna also known as abu aymen al masri was said to be an ideologist of the
group
meanwhile the defence ministry announced the arrest on saturday of three
suspected al qaeda members in the northern area of alb near the border with
saudi arabia
it identified them as ahmed al razehi yasser al zubai and ahmed al heemi it
said they were wearing military fatigues and carrying arms and explosives
saturday arrests were the latest in series of blows since late december
when yemen government launched its latest campaign against al qaeda
on tuesday security forces killed abdullah mehdar said to be the group
kingpin in shabwa province east of the capital
provincial governor ali hassan al ahmadi said dozens of fighters including
saudis and egyptians who had fled afghanistan were holed up in shabwa

number two saeed ali al shehri and radical us yemeni cleric anwar al awlaqi
on january officials announced the capture of key leader mohammed al hanq and
two other militants believed to be behind threats against western interests in
sanaa that caused embassies to close for several days
aqap has claimed responsibility for the failed december attack on us
airliner washington confirmed the al qaeda franchise in yemen was behind the
attack and that it trained the nigerian assailant umar farouk abdulmutallab
yemen is under us pressure to clamp down on al qaeda and analysts say that the
government in the impoverished state is keen to show the world it can crush al
qaeda militants on its own
yemen wants to avoid foreign military intervention targeting al qaeda said
adel al ahmadi yemeni specialist on the group
yemen is trying to say that it can accomplish the mission on its own and just
needs logistical assistance and political support to consolidate its regime
in the face of local adversaries
for sanaa the successive and successful strikes carried out since december
prove that logistical and intelligence assistance is more effective than direct
intervention by foreign forces said analyst said ali obeid al jamhi
the council of yemeni clerics warned on thursday of jihad or holy war if there
is any foreign military intervention in the country
an international conference on yemen will be held in london on january

american positions in new computer generated photo of al qaeda leader osama
bin laden el mundo newspaper reported saturday
the fbi contemporary representation of bin laden with greying hair and

geneva jan afp
tens of thousands of people in the haitian capital are living in the streets or
in makeshift camps after their homes were destroyed by this week deadly
earthquake the icrc said saturday
some people are camped out at the capital place du champ de mars alone
said the international committee of the red cross
tens of thousands of people are now living in on the streets and in
makeshift camps which cover nearly every inch of open space in port au prince
said simon schorno an icrc spokesman who is now in the haitian capital
residents have gathered at around points across the city while others are
squeezing onto buses in bid to leave the capital and seek shelter at
relatives homes in the countryside
it utter chaos he said in statement
there is destruction in every neighbourhood people are walking around looking
for food for help

afghan lawmakers reject most of karzai cabinet picks
kabul jan afp
afghan lawmakers saturday rejected more than half of president hamid karzai
second list of cabinet nominees following an earlier rejection of most of his
first choices the speaker said
in vote aired live on state television parliamentarians voted in secret
ballot to reject of the picks and approved only seven for the second ever
elected government of afghanistan mohammad younus qanooni said
the ministers who were confirmed included karzai former national security
adviser zalmai rasoul who will be foreign minister and amina afzali as
minister of women affairs
on january lawmakers voted against of karzai original choices
delivering blow to his authority already undermined after he was declared
winner of an august election marred by massive fraud mostly in his favour
karzai presented other new appointees men and three women as his
second choice and is yet to put forward name for the ministry of water and
power
parliamentarians diplomats and analysts said earlier they expected up to
third of his second round of choices to be rejected in secret ballot
members of afghanistan wolesi jirga the lower house many wearing turbans and
traditional salwar kameez spent the week grilling the new nominees after being
ordered by karzai to cancel their winter break to consider the list
those approved included ministers of justice foreign affairs religious
affairs economy rural development social affairs and counter narcotics
ministers for defence agriculture interior finance education culture and
mines and industries were approved in the first round of voting
karzai now needs to introduce new faces for approval to complete his cabinet
but cannot nominate anyone who has already been rejected
there has been high degree of absenteeism during the questioning of the
nominees and expect large number of them perhaps one third will be
rejected haroun mir director of afghanistan centre for research and policy
studies said before the voting started
lack of political parties means there is little cohesion among lawmakers or
consultation before they vote
parliament initial rejection of names was seen as huge blow to karzai
who is under enormous pressure to prove his commitment to clean and competent
government in return for ongoing western support to rebuild the country and
fight taliban insurgents
the approvals of the first round however had satisfied karzai supporters in
western capitals that the portfolios seen as pivotal to development plans had
been filled by clean and competent technocrats
one senior european diplomat said ministries were likely to be clustered with
the seven biggest ministries overseeing the clusters
what we are likely to see to see is two tier system and the magnificent
seven will be the dominant figures in the cabinet with the institutional clout
and technical capabilities and political elbows to manage the details he said
speaking on condition of anonymity
karzai office issued statement quoting him saying he regretted that such
large proportion of his nominees had been rejected but that he respected the
constitutional decision of the parliament
he said he had made his choices based on merit professionalism and national
partnership
the rejection has left the country without fully functioning government
dragging out the political stasis that has prevailed since the august election
diplomats said karzai wants government in place ahead of an international
conference in london on january to discuss the country future
the conference will provide an opportunity for afghanistan and its western
supporters who together have troops fighting the taliban led
