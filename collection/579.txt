cricket icc to investigate review controversy
johannesburg jan afp
cricket governing body the international cricket council icc is to launch
formal investigation into the controversy over the television review system that
erupted during the fourth test between south africa and england at the wanderers
stadium
icc chief executive haroon lorgat said letter of complaint had been received
from the england and wales cricket board ecb and an investigation would be
held after the test
england complained after television umpire daryl harper failed to overturn not
out decision against south african captain graeme smith on friday because harper
allegedly failed to turn up the sound on an audio feed from the stump
microphone
according to an ecb statement in the ecb and the england team management
view the agreed protocol was not implemented and the sound was not turned up on
review
as result tv replay which indicated that bat had made contact with ball was
heard by millions of television viewers but not by the match control team
lorgat said the exact circumstances would be investigated
there is large amount of controversy speculation and potentially unfair
criticism circulating at present so it is important to establish the exact facts
before reaching any final conclusions
this is early days for the decision review system and so far we are pleased
with its effectiveness and the value it can add to the game in support of
umpires
however we have always acknowledged there is room for further improvement in
the available technology and this investigation will be conducted in that light
so the system becomes even more reliable
the england cricket board on saturday announced it had demanded reinstatement
of the review the england team lost when television umpire daryl harper made
gross error in rejecting an appeal against south african captain graeme smith
but england had used up their second and final review and the south african
innings was complete before the icc responded
match referee roshan mahanama earlier issued statement defending harper
saying the umpire followed the correct protocol in upholding not out decision
by on field umpire tony hill when smith was on during the second day play
on friday smith went on to make
mahanama denied telling england coach andy flower that harper had failed to
adjust the volume of an audio feed from the stump microphone
he said the volume on the third umpire feed was set by head engineer of the
host broadcaster the south african broadcasting corporation and an icc
technical adviser
if the audio level had been increased above its optimum level distortion on
the audio feed would have occurred and the feed might not have given clear
indication of the true sound

lawyer for french academic upbeat after final iran hearing
tehran jan afp
french academic clotilde reiss lawyer expressed confidence she would be
acquitted after she appeared in court in tehran on saturday on charges of acting
against iranian national security during anti government protests in june
lawyer mohammad ali mahdavi sabet told afp that the two hour hearing was the
final one in the long running case which has tested iran ties with france
and that he now expected the court to announce its verdict within seven days
reiss who has been staying at the french embassy in tehran since being released
on bail in august was in court for the hearing the third in her trial mahdavi
sabet said
she and made our last defence submissions he said
in my closing statement for the defence rejected all the accusations against
her and said that she has not committed any crime
asked for her acquittal and am very confident and optimistic about her
acquittal he said
this was her last court session after that ms reiss left for the embassy
they will tell me the verdict when it is ready under iranian law the court
has week to issue its verdict mahdavi sabet added
french diplomatic source in paris said the ambassador and first counsellor
from the tehran embassy attended the hearing
we are now waiting calmly for the verdict the source said adding that reiss
went back to the french embassy at the end of the hearing
the year old academic was arrested on july shortly before she was due to
fly home after six month study and teaching visit to the iranian city of
isfahan
she was accused of taking photos and emailing material on the protests that
erupted after the disputed re election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad in june
and handing them to diplomat at the french embassy
france has strongly protested her innocence on all charges
on tuesday france served notice that it expects reiss to be acquitted
we expect that her innocence will be recognized by iranian justice and we want
clotilde reiss to return to france as soon as possible foreign ministry
spokesman bernard valero said
the arrest of reiss has stoked tensions between france and iran which already
are at odds over tehran nuclear programme and paris harsh criticism of the
regime crackdown on opposition protesters
reiss was one of scores of people paraded before cameras at televised trial
before being remanded in custody in tehran notorious evin jail
iran opposition which charges the election was massively rigged to keep
hardliner ahmadinejad in power has dismissed the court proceedings as show
trials
paris has accused tehran of trying to blackmail it into releasing an iranian
agent ali valiki rad who is serving life sentence in france for the
murder of an exiled former prime minister shapour bakhtiar
tehran has never confirmed making such proposal
in addition iranian engineer majid kakavand arrested in paris in march
and accused of breaking the us trade embargo on iran is awaiting court
decision next month on us application to extradite him
the engineer has been mentioned in the case of reiss although the iranian
ambassador in paris has denied wanting to swap the pair
iran arrested thousands of people during and after the opposition protests and
has put several hundred of them on trial on charges of either inciting or taking
part in the demonstrations

eu pushes for deeper carbon emissions cuts
seville spain jan afp
the eu remained firm saturday on its push to move to percent cut in carbon
dioxide emissions by despite the failure of last month un climate summit
to secure legally binding deal
several participants at an informal meeting of european environment ministers in
seville in southeastern spain said the proposal must remain on the table in the
wake of the failed copenhagen summit to keep the momentum in global climate
talks going
we definitely think we should maintain the percent offer we think it is
very very important it has always been conditional offer but it is very
important signal that it is maintained british energy and climate change
minister ed miliband told reporters
the nation european union had agreed ahead of the climate talks in denmark to
cut carbon dioxide emissions by percent over the next decade from levels
and to deepen those cuts to percent if other nations followed suit
but the offer failed to inspire other nations to raise their targets for
emissions cuts as had been hoped
the united states and canada have both proposed reducing their carbon emissions
by just percent over levels while australia plans percent cut
the climate summit ended with deal that set the aim of limiting warming to two
degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit but did not set legally binding targets
to reduce the emissions of gases that scientists say are heating up the world
atmosphere to dangerous levels
the roughly nations which signed on to the accord have until the end of the
month to declare their official carbon reduction commitments
