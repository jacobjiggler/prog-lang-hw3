kenya wants immediate deportation of jamaican cleric
nairobi jan afp
kenya wants the immediate deportation of radical jamaican muslim cleric
minister said saturday day after youths demanding his release clashed with
police claiming five lives
abdullah al faisal who is on global terror watchlist and served four years in
british jail for inciting racial hatred has been in kenyan custody since last
week after the authorities tried and failed to deport him
the man must leave this country as soon as possible interior minister george
saitoti told reporters
it is matter of great insult that foreigner would come to this country and
be the source of terrible misunderstanding among kenyans and lead to destruction
of property and injury of people he added
on friday at least five people were killed in riots in which scores of muslim
youths hurled rocks at police who repelled them with live rounds and teargas
saitoti also said sympathisers of somalia al qaeda inspired shebab may have
taken part in the protests
we know that there are elements sympathetic to the al shebab and there may be
some of them around here he said those elements had planned much bigger
mayhem than what you saw yesterday
faisal lawyers and rights groups have complained that the cleric is being held
without charge
police and immigration officials said at the time they arrested the imam for
violating immigration regulations by preaching
faisal was arrested in britain in after spending years urging his
audiences to kill jews hindus and westerners
kenya attempts to deport the cleric first to tanzania and then to gambia
have failed due to the refusal by authorities and airlines to grant him entry

football novo extends rangers lead at the top
hamilton scotland jan afp
rangers extended their lead at the top of the scottish premier league after
nacho novo late strike secured win over hamilton on saturday
walter smith side laboured for long periods at new douglas park before novo
finally broke the deadlock with minutes
the spaniard goal allowed the defending champions to pull points clear of
second placed celtic but tony mowbray men can close the gap with victory
against falkirk later on saturday and also have another game in hand still to
play
smith made three changes to the side held to draw by hamilton in the
scottish cup last sunday kenny miller and lee mcculloch were both suspended and
kris boyd was sidelined after undergoing groin surgery with novo kevin thomson
and maurice edu coming in
novo gave rangers an early opening when he flicked on for kyle lafferty but the
northern ireland striker fired over under pressure from hamilton goalkeeper
tomas cerny
hamilton squandered golden opportunity to take shock lead when simon mensing
slipped pass through to mickael antoine curier who touched on for marco
paixao but he smashed his effort wide from close range
mensing went even closer when he blasted shot past rangers goalkeeper allan
mcgregor only for danny wilson to clear off the line
antoine curier was constant menace in the first half and he tried his luck
with powerful strike which flashed wide of the target
steven davis shot over from just outside the area as rangers struggled to find
any fluidity before the break
smith would have demanded far more dynamic display at half time and rangers
were able to pile on more pressure after the break
steven whittaker was close with well struck effort which whistled across the
face of goal
whittaker had another chance when he collected davis ball out on the left only
to shoot into the side netting with weak effort
lafferty should have done better than head over with tame effort midway
through the half
antoine curier was agonisingly close to putting hamilton ahead moments later but
his snap shot just missed the target
paixao threatened with superb overhead kick that was just off target and
rangers having rode their luck went ahead in the th minute
sasa papac picked out substitute john fleck and his shot was parried by cerny to
novo who squeezed home from an acute angle

how relief work is being coordinated and what the nation eu can do to
consolidate and strengthen the efforts

activists scuffle with police over hong kong rail project
hong kong jan afp
more than protesters staged sit in outside hong kong legislative
council late saturday after lawmakers approved controversial billion
dollar high speed railway project
the group surrounded the council building and refused to let transport chief eva
cheng and other government officials leave after lawmakers voted in favour of
the project at the end of an eight hour meeting
withdraw the proposal eva cheng shame on you the protesters mostly
students and young professionals chanted as hundreds of policemen looked on
cheng was in her car in the council carpark for about an hour before she was
forced to return to the building with protesters refusing to leave
nobody can represent our voice so we came here tonight to make our voice
heard henry lam told afp
police earlier used pepper spray on some of the protesters as they tried to
break through barricade
the council meeting was the third held to discuss funding approval for the
project which will link hong kong and guangzhou capital of neighbouring
guangdong province
the guangzhou shenzhen hong kong rail link will form part of china national
high speed rail network and allow people to travel from hong kong to guangzhou
in minutes just under half the current duration of the journey
officials say the project is important for fostering economic ties between hong
kong and major cities on the chinese mainland and hope construction will be
completed by around
the project has been through year consultation it is an important
investment cheng said after the meeting
pro democracy legislators tried to delay the decision saying the public had not
been properly consulted and that the scheme was over priced
they also said it would benefit only developers while forcing villagers along
the route to relocate
protesters said the project received the green light only because the election
system allows the majority of the legislative council seats to be filled by pro
government politicians
at present only half of hong kong legislature is directly elected while
largely pro beijing committee effectively controls the selection of the
remainder and appoints the city chief executive
more than protesters staged sit in outside the official residence of
hong kong chief executive donald tsang late friday to urge the government to
drop the project
britain brown seeks to woo middle classes
london jan afp
british prime minister gordon brown saturday sought to win over middle class
voters ahead of general election with promises of more jobs as his labour
party struggles to stay in power
brown said labour would create more middle class jobs than ever before if the
party overcomes its lag in opinion polls and wins national vote which must be
held by june
brown has previously sniped at main opposition centre right conservative leader
david cameron for his privileged education and background
that led the tories to accuse him of fighting an old fashioned left wing class
war in bid to shore up labour traditional vote in the face of looming
defeat
in major speech to centre left activists brown said social mobility will be
our theme for the coming election and the coming parliamentary term
fair society is one where everyone who works hard and plays by the rules has
chance to fulfil their dreams whether that owning bigger house taking
holiday abroad buying new car or starting small business
this is the next project for new labour the coming decade will provide the
uk with more middle class jobs than ever before
brown also wrote in the guardian newspaper on saturday that he wanted to see an
expanded middle class not squeezed middle class
opportunity and reward cannot be hoarded at the top and it is not enough to
protect people at the bottom he said
labour manifesto would be pitched at anyone who wants to get home start
business build career or save for their children future the premier
wrote
the conservatives blasted brown latest move
one minute gordon brown class warrior the next he is friend of middle
britain said tory treasury spokesman philip hammond
middle britain won forget that it was gordon brown who destroyed their
pensions increased their taxes and crippled social mobility
the idea that man who has spent his whole career at war with the middle
classes can be their champion is laughable
meanwhile brown de facto deputy business secretary peter mandelson said
veering to the left was not winning strategy as every member of the
government knows
the election is not won by us nor is it yet lost he told the daily telegraph
newspaper
mandelson also said the new percent top income tax rate for those earning
more than pounds dollars euros year should be
abandoned as soon as the public finances allow it
elsewhere on saturday britain ruled out copying the united states by proposing
special tax on banks to recover state funds used to bailout lenders during the
financial crisis
finance minister alistair darling told the scotsman newspaper that the
government would not be matching proposal announced by us president barack
obama on thursday for new fee on major banking firms
he added that britain would recover state aid by eventually selling stakes
recently built up in rescued british banks

baghdad jan afp
iraq former pro western prime minister iyad allawi on saturday unveiled

saddam hussein was provisionally appointed by washington as iraq first
premier after the dictator ouster in the us led invasion of

verbal salvo at maliki

religious communities hashemi told candidates and onlookers at the launch
ceremony at al rasheed hotel in baghdad

football cup row adds spice to milan derby build up
rome jan afp
with the crucial milan derby between the top two teams in serie just week
away furious row has broken out between the neighbours over the scheduling of
the next round of coppa italia fixtures
under the original cup scheduling milan were due to host udinese in the
quarter finals next wednesday while inter were to host juventus also at the san
siro on the thursday of the following week
but milan asked the football league to have their match put back so they too
could have free week ahead of the derby
the league response was to schedule milan clash with udinese the day before
inter clash with juventus meaning the nerazzurro would have to play on the
san siro pitch just hours after another match had already been played there
that has left inter officials fuming
it unacceptable that the calendar is changed and organised so that two
matches on the same pitch are played hours apart and the second is match as
prestigious as inter juventus said inter director ernesto paolillo
all this is absurd it ridicules the national cup competition and the
professional football league
we ask officially to play on wednesday january rather than looking for new
date for fiorentina milan which was already programmed for certain date
the fiorentina milan match which was called off in december due to bad weather
was due to be played on january which was why milan cup match needed to be
played the week before
but now that milan request to be given free week ahead of the derby has been
accepted their match at fiorentina has been put back to wednesday february
as has udinese clash against cagliari
essentially three matches have been moved and two games will be played on the
same pitch hours apart
milan coach leonardo says it got nothing to do with him though
not having any commitments in the week leading up to the derby is of course
good thing for us he said
but with all the other things have to think about don want to get
distracted by anything these are things which are related to rules and to those
who make decisions

quake sparks massive exodus from haitian capital
port au prince jan afp
standing at bus station next to her husband and four children talulum saint
fils looks determined to get out of the haitian capital that some now refer to
as hell
go to any place but away from this city she repeats again and again
and many haitians share her scathing view of port au prince massively destroyed
by tuesday magnitude earthquake
thousands of residents have fled the city in recent days saying they were tired
of sleeping in the street afraid of being robbed by ruthless gangs or simply
fearful of new powerful aftershocks that might destroy buildings that still
remain standing
if the city dwellers have relatives in the country they gather what left of
their personal belongings and hit the road in the hope of waiting out the
catastrophe in parts of haiti that have suffered less damage
the streets smell of death saint fils goes on in distress there is no
assistance of any kind and our children simply cannot live like animals
to buy one way tickets to fodernerg small city three hours away from the
capital the family had to sell jewelry to come up with gourdes dollars
twice the usual fare
like to rebuild our house but where will we get the money to do it she
asks
when the bus comes it is packed and those who could not squeeze themselves on
it cannot hide their anger but bus operators just shake their heads
we carry twice as many passengers as usual and we have doubled the fare because
there is no gasoline and no security in the city argues jaino nony owner of
several buses but that the right price for getting out of hell
aanoz richard year old baker who has become homeless after the quake is
livid because his savings were not enough to pay the fare
look this is my house and this is my bed now he says pointing in despair
toward the street
another bus packed with passengers and their belongings leaves the station
taking to distant city family who have spent hours waiting for any
available transportation and negotiating the fare
they say the government is receiving millions of dollars in aid but we have
not seen cent laments islaine mother of three children we and our
children have been left in the street and we have no other option but to leave
even though we have spent our whole lives here
she says she would like to return to port au prince one day but does not know
if that will be possible
the exodus is now visibly affecting the haitian capital as some of the hardest
hit neighborhoods look empty
woman who identified herself as braubrin high school teacher said she felt
fortunate to be alive because the earthquake had completely destroyed her house
but she does not hide her disappointment in the haitian government
the haitian governments have never done anything for the people braubrin
says we are absolutely dependant of other countries but we can just sit
here surrounded by dead bodies and wait for somebody to come and rescue us
half empty bus from the province pulls into the station bringing in farmer
alix bonfils who came to look for his missing brothers
we have not heard from them since the quake and cannot bear this uncertainty
any longer says bonfils
he looks at the devastation around him and says he cannot believe his eyes
we knew it was serious he throws up his hands but one really cannot realize
how serious before seeing it with his own eyes
