it is also performing operations at what is left of port au prince general
hospital universitaire de la paix
with no electricity or running water the doctors are working under very
difficult conditions and the wounded keep pouring in
at last word green was at the makeshift hospital preparing to amputate young
haitian boy crushed ankle
normally this would be standard procedure but the doctor was doing it by the
light of lantern without antibiotics or pain medicine
have never seen such devastation and suffering he said in brief satellite
phone call there are no more tears
just two weeks before the quake hit green and his team were hosting fundraiser
with the haitian government to build clinic in port au prince the donated
land is now pile of rubble strewn with dead bodies and broken dreams
technology comes to the aid of haiti
washington jan afp
online maps mobile phone donations wikis and slew of websites are being
deployed as telecoms firms technology giants and startups set aside their
rivalries and put the latest tools to work to help earthquake ravaged haiti
technology is playing key role in mobilizing support for the victims of the
haiti earthquake and also in coordinating relief efforts said akhtar badshah
microsoft senior director of global community affairs
badshah in blog post said microsoft had donated million dollars and was
working with nethope which brings together care mercycorps worldvision and
other humanitarian organizations with technology companies
cisco and intel are also members of nethope which is seeking to establish
internet connectivity for the various relief agencies on the ground helping
victims of tuesday quake which left tens of thousands of people dead
microsoft said nethope haiti emergency center was already serving as focal
point for reports events contact lists and collaboration
google besides making one million dollar donation for rescue and relief
offered its online mapping and satellite imagery tools to aid workers so they
can better evaluate damage and coordinate responses
the internet giant also created web page devoted to linking people with
charitable groups such as the american red cross or doctors without borders
apple meanwhile was allowing itunes users to make donations of from five
dollars to dollars to the red cross directly from their accounts at the
online music store
millions of dollars in donations to the red cross yele charity set up by
haitian born hip hop singer wyclef jean and others have been raised after us
mobile phone companies made it easy to contribute money by text message
yele and help haiti remained among the most popular topics on twitter on
friday as users of the microblogging service vital source of news in the
first hours of the quake urged one another to give by text message
us telecom companies from at amp to verizon announced donations for
relief efforts free calls to haiti or assistance in helping rebuild its
shattered communications infrastructure
haiti need for communications services is extraordinary and urgent said
julius genachowski chairman of the us federal communications commission
it is vitally important that people on the ground in haiti have the
communications capacity to conduct rescue and recovery missions connect with
loved ones and move forward with overall recovery efforts he said
telecoms without borders deployed two emergency teams to set up satellite
facilities for use by emergency responders and planned another network to allow
people to make free two minute calls anywhere in the world to relatives
on the web number of sites were posting pictures and messages aimed at
reuniting families or locating missing persons including the international
committee of the red cross familylinks icrc org and the haitian earthquake
registry at haitianquake com
google was offering person finder at haiticrisis appspot com while an
earthquake haiti group on facebook was providing similar service and had
attracted more than members as of friday afternoon
the new york times was also posting pictures of the missing on its website as
was another us news organization cnn through its ireport site
the haiti volunteer network at haitivolunteer org was bringing together
volunteers and organizations while microsoft and google were united with yahoo
and others in collaborative online wiki project called crisiscommons org
we collect data like imagery from satellites and information on twitter or
flickr then distribute it to ngos who can remix it to fit their own needs said
sean gorman founder of fortiusone one of the participants
satellite images for example can help aid groups trucking in supplies avoid
blocked roads or locate victims
another online tool ushahidi which was developed to monitor post election
violence in kenya in and means testimony in swahili is also being used
to map the destruction in haiti
ushahidi collects information through mobile phone email or web services such
as twitter or flickr and uses google maps to create an interactive map and
timeline
tomorrow we will have lots of information coming by sms because cell networks
will be back up said ushahidi patrick meier co founder of the
international network of crisis mappers

aid has arrived but is badly coordinated haitian president
port au prince jan afp
haiti president rene preval friday praised massive international relief
effort for his stricken country but warned that the aid operation remains
uncoordinated
we need international aid but the problem is the coordination the haitian
president told afp
preval said planes from countries including the united states france and
venezuela had arrived at port au prince overwhelmed airport in single day
for the government part what we can do is to ask of the aid workers to work
in committees that we have set up within the government to ensure the most
effective distribution of the aid sent by the international community he said
haiti health ministry said friday that the massive quake that struck the
caribbean nation tuesday afternoon has killed more than people and
injured some
preliminary estimate said million people had been affected by the quake
we need international aid insisted preval who was forced to set up
makeshift seat of government at police station near port au prince small
airport after the earthquake destroyed the presidential palace and numerous
government ministries
the haitian leader said his government has set out certain priorities for
helping their devastated countrymen beginning with the distribution of gas so
vehicles can deliver much needed aid and food throughout port au prince
billionaire ex president in dead heat in chile election
santiago jan afp
flamboyant rightwing billionaire and an uncharismatic ex president are neck
and neck rivals in knockout weekend election for chile presidency that is
putting the leftwing year hold on power in the balance
voter intention surveys put sebastian pinera media magnate and big
stakeholder in chile flagship lan airline and eduardo frei cold fish
politician who was head of state from to in technical dead heat
pinera is credited with percent of intended ballots while frei is
projected to pick up percent according to the latest survey last
wednesday
that slender difference is much less than the survey margin of error meaning
the outcome of sunday poll is impossible to call
the two are the only candidates left standing after december first round
vote knocked out other presidential hopefuls
the confidence exuded by pinera in that phase was backed by the percent of
the vote he received much more than the percent picked up by frei
that score led pundits to predict that pinera was on track to end the two
decade grip on power enjoyed by the leftwing concertacion ruling coalition ever
since the exit of dictator general augusto pinochet
but redoubling of efforts by outgoing president michelle bachelet who
constitutionally cannot stand for another term to pass on some of her skyhigh
popularity to the hapless frei appears to have paid dividends
an endorsement in frei favor by an independent leftist defeated in the first
round former film director marco enriquez ominami also looks to have helped
turn the tide
it abusive what the government has done to use and abuse public money
public institutions and even public employees the interfering campaign it
done is not fair and is not clean pinera complained in radio interview on
friday
pinera was especially nettled by comment made by bachelet on thursday that she
would vote for frei because he was honest
the message bachelet was pushing was clear that pinera multiple business
interests made him less than ideal candidate to run chile vibrant economy
some analysts though believed pinera tycoon status could work as much for
him as against him
for many people this factor is not handicap but rather an advantage if
pinera is able to create wealth for himself many think he can also do so for
everybody one political observer marta lagos said
pinera ability to distance himself from the pinochet regime notably for
having voted against continuation of the dictatorship in also seemed to
play well with the electorate
frei in comparison has gone forth in technocrat fashion focusing his campaign
on promising voters that social development programs established by bachelet
would be maintained
each vote counts each vote in each polling station will make the difference in
this election he said friday urging vigilance by ballot box observers
haitian mass graves receive unclaimed unidentified bodies
port au prince jan afp
every five minutes vehicle pulled up to the gates of port au prince
cemetery delivering another corpse to mass grave dug by authorities trying to
clear the broken city streets of the dead
we have lost any dignity in death said mezen dieu justi an old man barely
able to contain his nausea and tears before the grim spectacle
the massive earthquake that struck haiti on tuesday has produced steady stream
of bodies with estimates of the death toll well into the tens of thousands
many families confronted with their final glimpse of loved one simply lost
control
it my father my dear father screamed one young woman who fainted at the
sight of the mass grave filled with human bodies
one woman as though possessed lowered herself into the grave saying she felt
more comfortable among the dead bystanders eventually forced her back out
again
we have lost our senses death has driven us insane said one haitian whose
relative body had been transported to the grave for burial
for three days my sister was dead in her house finally we brought her here we
have lost hope of giving her dignified burial coffin the blessing of
priest sobbed florence teacher
across port au prince the dead litter the streets stripped of human dignity
decomposing and covered in flies
the efforts of recently arrived foreign aid workers seem almost inconsequential
by comparison with the scale of the devastation wrought by the quake
their work is both race against time to save people who may still be alive
under the rubble strewn across the city and also an effort to transport
overwhelming numbers of corpses to the nearest mass grave
morgue officials said they no longer have the means to move the bodies forcing
aid workers to transport scores of unidentified and dust covered cadavers
families waited patiently as rescue teams dug through the rubble waiting to see
if they could recognize loved one
the truth is that we don know what will be done with the dead said joseph
tihaly haitian volunteer coordinating the delivery and identification of
corpses abandoned at the general hospital morgue
the young student said numerous families had come seeking their relatives but
the majority of the bodies remained unclaimed and unidentified
in one corner of the morgue haitian man finished building makeshift wooden
coffin to hold his brother body
will try to take him to our village to bury him there he said
at least two mass graves have been dug in the city to try to deal with the
catastrophe haiti prime minister jean max bellerive said he believed some
people had already been interred across the stricken capital
but the sheer number of dead has simply overwhelmed all efforts said tihaly
realistically we don know when these bodies will be taken and we don know
by whom it chaos and breeding ground for infection he said
france says guinea accord decisive opening way to cooperation
paris jan afp
an agreement by guinea political rivals to sideline the ailing junta chief and
hold elections in six months was decisive stage opening the way to
cooperation french foreign minister bernard kouchner said saturday
thanks to the commitments made guinea has marked decisive stage in getting
out of the crisis it has been in for year and on the way to state of law and
justice kouchner said in statement
france will resolutely back the application of this declaration and in this
framework can soon resume its cooperation it will attempt to mobilize guinea
partners so that they can accompany the process toward elections
the minister who said recently return to the ex french colony by junta chief
dadis camara could start civil war said france gave its full backing to
number two sekouba konate in carrying out the terms of the declaration signed
friday in ouagadougou capital of burkina faso
the pact said camara should effectively remain in exile following december
assassination attempt that led to his being hospitalised in morocco camara is
now in burkina faso
the accord was signed by camara interim junta chief konate and burkina faso
president blaise compaore who is mediating between the ruling junta and the
opposition
the pact provides for national transition council and unity government
before polls are held in six months
haiti must prepare for more massive quakes scientists
chicago jan afp
haiti and its neighbors must prepare themselves for more massive quakes after
the devastating tremors this week increased pressure along lengthy fault line
scientists warned friday
paul mann senior research scientist at the institute for geophysics at the
university of texas at austin warned that just because the rebuilding process
had started people shouldn assume the risk was over
this relief of stress along this area near port au prince may have actually
increased stress in the adjacent segments on the fault he told afp
researchers have already begun to work on models to try to predict how the
stress changes resulting from the magnitude quake which struck tuesday is
affecting the adjacent segments of the fault
this fault system is hundreds of kilometers long and the segment that ruptured
to form this ear quake is only kilometers long mann said in telephone
