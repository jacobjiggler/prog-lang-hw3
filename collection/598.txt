football late cheyrou strike checks man bordeaux
paris jan afp
benoit cheyrou struck an st minute equaliser to earn marseille draw at
bordeaux on sunday that kept his side in the title race albeit points behind
the league leaders with game in hand
defending champions bordeaux led through contested steve mandanda own goal on
the cusp of half time but lost goalkeeper cedric carrasso to injury and then had
centre back marc planus sent off
the numerical advantage allowed marseille to boss the match for the first time
and they snatched point when cheyrou chested down knockdown before volleying
past substitute keeper ulrich rame after bordeaux defenders had been sucked
towards brandao at the defence of free kick
the visitors came close to victory in the closing stages but rame saved
superbly from lucho gonzalez instinctive toe poke and mathieu valbuena flashed
low right footed shot narrowly wide
bordeaux now lead the french top flight by seven points from lille while
marseille climb above lyon to fourth
the opening goal went down as mandanda own goal but it owed everything to
superb cross from advancing centre back mickael ciani and the single mindedness
of marouane chamakh whose strong aerial challenge forced the france
international goalkeeper to divert the ball into his own net
the away side protested fiercely about the legitimacy of chamakh leap but
referee laurent duhamel turned deaf ear
it was shortly before the hour mark that bordeaux lost carrasso to an injury
apparently sustained taking free kick deep inside his own half
rame took over between the sticks and quickly found himself exposed when mamadou
niang earned free kick right on the edge of the bordeaux area having been
felled by planus who was promptly dismissed
planus expulsion was harsh given the presence of covering defender in the
form of ciani but cheyrou could not capitalise with the dead ball
laurent blanc had deployed chamakh as lone central focal point and bordeaux
attacking midfielders pressed high up the pitch pinning marseille deep inside
their own half and cutting off marseille own forward trident of niang brandao
and fabrice ariel
the tactic gave bordeaux control of proceedings in the first half but clear cut
chances were scarce
ciani had shot deflected over the crossbar following neat turn in the
marseille penalty box in the fifth minute while wendel and yoann gourcuff both
drew straightforward saves from mandanda
in saturday action in form lille stretched their winning run to eight matches
in all competitions and galvanised their grasp on second place by beating paris
saint germain
on the first weekend programme of fixtures after the winter break lyon got
their season back on track with win at nancy while montpellier beat nice
to hold onto third place in the table point shy of lille

brazilian bounced back from his midweek sending off in the kings cup victory
over recreativo huelva with rare goal

in haiti slums rubble set alight to burn bodies
morne lazarre haiti jan afp
the stench of burning bodies hung over slums clinging to haitian hillside
sunday as residents abandoned the search for survivors among the rubble and
torched the squalid ruins
despairing that five days after the magnitude quake there were no more
people alive and no way of extracting the dead they set fire to the rubble in
the mont lazarre slum outside the capital port au prince to stop the spread of
disease
we can get those who are in the ruins of their homes out so we re setting
them on fire using old tires and little gas said resident emmanuel
they decided to go ahead with the massive inferno after dutch rescue teams and
their sniffer dogs could find no signs of life
for the poorest of the poor in the slums which were home to about
people the quake has left them completely destitute
it unimaginable what has happened here said bernard another resident who
offered to act as guide through this place of misery and despair which the
authorities have yet to visit
here is the ruins of the supermarket there the apartments collapsed on top of
their occupants man died there with his three children junior and his
fiancee lived there said bernard who knew them all
we managed to save few people on the night of the quake but after that there
was nothing we could do it was too late for most of them
the area looks like battlefield hundreds have died almost all the homes were
destroyed
before the tiny shacks had risen up the hillside as far as the eye could see at
times jostling for space with the luxury villas in the neighboring once chic
area of petionville
but tuesday quake has wiped out any distinction between the two both now
reduced to rubble
there is no more neighborhood we are all in the street said dieuseul who
lost two children
this place is now uninhabitable even the dogs can live here that means that
we have to look after ourselves said the young man with an air of
desperation
the slums are percent destroyed said germain pressoir lawmaker who
lives in the area and like his neighbors now finds himself on the streets
squatting in the courtyard of school
like much of the rest of haiti the need for food and water is desperate in this
area but help has yet to arrive
obama mobilizes reserves to help haiti
washington jan afp
us president barack obama sunday mobilized military reserves to help quake hit
haiti particularly medical staff to work on hospital ships and coast guard
staff to secure the ports
in presidential order obama wrote it was necessary to augment the active
armed forces of the united states for the effective conduct of operational
missions including those involving humanitarian assistance related to relief
efforts in haiti
he said he was authorizing defense secretary robert gates and homeland security
secretary janet napolitano to order to active duty any units of the reserve as
needed
the order would help both departments to support the massive us aid operation in
haiti devastated by magnitude quake on tuesday
it will be used on limited basis principally to support targeted functions
associated with this humanitarian mission the white house stressed in
statement
for instance it will allow for the call up of reserve medical personnel to
replace those deployed on the hospital ship comfort and it will allow for the
deployment of coast guard unit that will help provide port security
obama also sent letter to house speaker nancy pelosi informing congress of the
move
eu set to send over mln euros to haiti
brussels jan afp
european union nations are set to announce monday at least million euros in
funds to rebuild quake struck haiti on top of emergency aid and call for an
international conference to back the effort
at extraordinary talks in brussels the nation eu development ministers
will also discuss the launch of security mission to help keep law and order
amid the chaos caused by people desperate to get food and water
the amount in question is three figures that is more than million euros
million dollars an diplomat said on the eve of the meeting in brussels
which starts at gmt and is expected to run just over two hours
the final amount could even go above million euros he added
the money is aimed at medium and long term work to rebuild after the quake
which is believed to have killed more than people injured quarter of
million more and left million homeless
it will come from eu budget funds not yet spent in other areas
the reconstruction money is also distinct from emergency aid of which eu
nations have already provided some million euros and which is expected to
grow considerably the diplomat said
meanwhile dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said the eu is also preparing
mission to help maintain law and order and provide security
if security is insufficient the aid to victims of the earthquake is going to
stop he said in statement after telephone talks with eu foreign affairs
chief catherine ashton
that why have insisted that the eu help guarantee security he said
adding that the nation bloc would study with the united nations what kind of
security mission including police might be needed
ashton spokesman said it was too early to tell whether such force would be
launched
the eu top diplomat will also take part in the talks with spanish foreign
minister miguel angel moratinos representing the eu presidency and deputy
prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega who visited haiti sunday
the whole of the world has to make commitment to haiti for the future and for
the long term part of the reason for the meeting tomorrow is beginning to put
the building blocks in place ashton told bbc television sunday
according to an initial eu damage assessment more than physical
structures were destroyed or damaged in the haitian capital port au prince by
the magnitude earthquake that struck on tuesday
but aid is difficult to get in given the number of planes and ships descending
on haiti to help while people in need have no way of knowing where to go to
find the food and water they so badly need
the logistics there at the moment are very very difficult ashton said
we ve got people going in we ve arranged for example for ships that can land
without needing port to be able to take the aid in in different ways she
said
another eu diplomat said the bloc is also likely to call for an international
reconstruction conference on haiti under the auspices of the united nations and
the world bank
after the meeting eu humanitarian aid commissioner karel de gucht will travel
to the haitian capital port au prince to assess first hand the needs of the
authorities and the people
he will be to look at how we make sure the communications are working
effectively clearly big issue putting things on the ground so that people
can actually work from desks be able to coordinate ashton said
all of that needs to happen as quickly as possible
de gucht will also meet haitian officials and un aid representatives to discuss
how relief work is being coordinated and what the eu can do to consolidate and
strengthen the efforts
ashton travels to new york on wednesday for meetings with us and un officials on
the destruction from tuesday earthquake

obama stumps for embattled democrat senate candidate
boston massachusetts jan afp
president barack obama stumped sunday for the democratic candidate in
massachusetts special senate election saying that his legislative agenda
depended on her winning
the seat which was occupied by edward kennedy for almost five decades before
his death in august was considered democratic stronghold but candidate
martha coakley finds herself struggling ahead of tuesday vote against
republican opponent scott brown
win by brown would strip the democrats of their th senate seat meaning
their majority was no longer big enough to easily override republican opposition
to obama bitterly fought health care reforms and other major projects
lot of these measures are going to rest on one vote in the united states
senate obama told noisy coakley rally in boston
that why the opponents of change and progress have been pouring money in he
said they want to keep things as they are
heckler interrupted obama provoking loud boos from the crowd at northeastern
university before the president was able to continue
the incident reflected the passionate and sometimes ugly nature of the partisan
divide year after obama took office
obama said the country was in tough times and acknowledged that people are
frustrated and they re angry and they have every right to be
then he attacked those including brown who he said are eager to exploit
that pain and anger
there are always folks who think that the best way to solve these problems are
to demonize others and unfortunately we are seeing some of that politics in
massachusetts today
one poll put coakley well ahead but suffolk university poll released late
thursday had brown ahead with
pollsters say the result may well depend on turnout with low participation
favoring brown
hope emerges from the ruins of haiti supermarket
port au prince jan afp
hello said the rescuer simple greeting that belied the enormity of the
moment as maria ariel and lamy were pulled from the debris after surviving more
than hours under the rubble living off supermarket food
the trio could not know it but the torturous route to their salvation after
haiti catastrophic earthquake had begun two days earlier thanks to text
message sent to the united nations
someone sent text message saying they were inside the caribbean market near
the fruit meat and frozen food aisles said joseph fernandez of south florida
urban search and rescue
the five story supermarket packed with people was just one speck on
the horizon of rubble that awaited rescuers from the united states turkey and
scores of other nations
but with the aid of that text message ultra sensitive microphones and dogged
perseverance engineers rescuers and other experts were able to hunt down signs
of life beneath the pancaked store
it took us hours said umut dingsahin turkish volunteer rescuer at the
scene during that time we were knocking and they were responding as we
advanced we began to hear murmurs
we are here to save you where are you the team shouted trying to reach
ariel aged just seven lamy and year old maria
then breakthrough seven responded ariel adding that she was stuck
next to dead man but as fate would have it covered with food
all three were surrounded by food so they could eat said fernandez so
unlike normal in this type of situation we have great possibility of saving
people on the sixth seventh or eighth day after the disaster
by early sunday the mood at the caribbean market had transformed from one of
somber determination to laughter and joy filled relief
it was electric when we saw the fruit of our labor when that little girl came
out said fernandez who had also found two other girls trapped in school
there was silence everyone was happy said turkish architect zeynep gul
