jardim brandao dithered on the ball in his own box and borriello dispossessed
him before trying to round curci
there was minimal contact between the pair and borriello crumpled to the ground
but the striker last touch had been too heavy and left him no chance of
reaching the ball before back tracking defender
even so the referee pointed to the spot and showed curci straight red card
substitute goalkeeper gianluca pegolo first task was to pick the ball out of
his net
siena battled on gamely and on minutes massimo maccarone someone escaped
three defenders on the edge of the milan box to bundle through before firing
over on the stretch as thiago silva came across to put him under pressure
yet just two minutes later the lead was doubled as andrea pirlo curled cross
into the near post and borriello hooked brilliant volley over his shoulder and
into the top corner
ronaldinho proved constant menace and had two early second half chances
flicking the ball over the bar with the first and being denied by pegalo with
the second
but minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home david
beckham corner
then having tricked his way into the area ronaldinho flicked the ball wide of
the far post but the brazilian finally sealed his first milan hat trick with
rocket into the top corner from outside the area minute from time
juventus slumped to their seventh defeat in games with reverse at
chievo that is sure to increase the pressure on under fire coach ciro ferrara
juve dropped to fifth and out of the champions league places as both as roma and
napoli overtook them

the club in win over free falling genoa

and then toni turned home mirko vucinic cross on the stroke of half time
and on the hour mark vucinic turned provider again for toni to head home his
second

still extended their unbeaten league run to matches

fifth time
substitute mohamadou idrissou headed the th minute winner to complete late
scoring flurry in which cameroon struck twice within five minutes to snatch the

gabon who fought out dour goalless draw with tunisia in the first half of

the former lyon paris saint germain and rangers boss added we found ourselves
in difficulty here because zambia play really well the first half was very
tough for us afterwards things got better but know they re good and that we
were fortunate to win and to take the three points
the frenchman made two changes from the team shocked by gabon in their
opening match with midfielder stephane mbia and striker tchoyi somen replacing
landry nguemo and achille webo
zambia also coached by frenchman in herve renard stuck with the side that
led tunisia before having to settle for draw in match they could easily
have won
the chipolopolo copper bullets needed no incentive to beat the indomitable
lions having suffered humiliating defeat against them at the same stage
of the last nations cup in ghana two years ago
renard had warned his squad that there is nothing more dangerous than wounded
lion and they heeded his advice by snapping at the feet of their more
illustrious opponents from the kick off
the in your face approach of country trying to reach the second round for the
first time since paid off after only eight minutes when netherlands based
mulenga struck
this goal once again exposed cameroon as team prone to slapstick defending
with careless geremi pass intercepted by felix katongo who burst past the
veteran defender and crossed from the left
rigobert song another long serving defender who was held responsible for the
gabon goal headed the ball against his goalkeeper carlos kameni as he attempted
to avert danger and the rebound fell to mulenga who tapped it home
cameroon boasted an attack starring three time african footballer of the year
eto but zambia goalkeeper kennedy mweene was not tested until the th minute
when he reacted swiftly to push away jean makoun drive
double save from kameni soon after saved cameroon from falling further behind
as he parried rainford kalaba free kick and got up quickly to foil katongo
who reached the rebound first
the second half goal deluge began on minutes when an innocuous geremi cross
from the touchline crept under the body of mweene into the far corner before
eto blocked clearance to fire his team in front four minutes later
katongo equalised when mulenga was sent flying by kameni only for idrissou to
soar above stoppila sunzu and head wide of mweene to give cameroon their third
triumph over zambia in four nations cup clashes

luanda jan afp
two human rights activists lawyer and priest have been arrested in the
angolan enclave of cabinda in the wake of deadly attack on the togolese
football team sources said sunday
the arrests were not believed to be in direct connection with the deadly january
separatist shooting that killed two and led to togo pulling out of the africa
cup of nations can but international lobby group human rights watch said it
appeared the attack was being used to justify other arrests
the angolan government is apparently trying to use the attack against the
togolese football team to justify broader crackdown on cabinda most
prominent intellectuals and human rights defenders hrw lisa rimli told afp
well respected cabindan lawyer francisco luemba was seized at his home early
sunday his son joao said he also said former priest raul tati and had been
picked up late on saturday
they came this morning very early and took my father joao luemba told afp
then they came back and searched the house and then his office and took many
documents away
we believe my father has been held because of book he wrote in about
cabinda
tati and luemba detentions follow the arrests last week of university
professor belchior lanso former police officer pedro fuca and chevron employee
jose zefarino pauti who are being held in cabinda prison believed to be on
suspected of crimes against state security
lawyer martinho nombo colleague of luemba and fellow member of former human
rights group mpalabanda which was shut down by the authorities in remains
at liberty contrary to earlier reports of his detention
speaking to afp from his home in cabinda nombo said he fears he may be next to
be picked up
according to information that have received could also be going to prison
he said
cabinda public prosecutor antonio nito could not confirm the arrests of tati
or luemba saying they had not yet been presented to the prosecutor office
rimli of human rights watch which has published several reports on arbitrary
arrests and detentions in cabinda said the detentions were very worrying
development
we are particularly concerned about the arrest of lawyers who have defended
many people who suffered arbitrary arrest torture and unfair trials
cabindan journalist fernando lelo who spent months in prison and was
condemned to years for crimes against state security before being released
said there was climate of fear in cabinda
it is significant that they are now arresting lawyers he said
security around the cup of nations remains extremely high in the province which
is separated from angola by thin sliver of the democratic republic of congo
players from ghana ivory coast and burkina faso among them premiership stars
