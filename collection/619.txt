cape town were drawn with england nine down in their second innings on both
occasions
south african captain graeme smith said proud of the way the guys
performed in this test match we were under pressure coming into this game
we got close in two of the games but credit must go to andrew and england for
their resilient performances in centurion and cape town and the way they played
in durban
strauss said he was disappointed with the way his team had performed in their
final match
but very proud of the way the team performed over the ten weeks we ve been
here to win the one day series was huge achievement and to halve the test
series against one of the best teams in the world
south african wicketkeeper mark boucher and england off spinner graeme swann
shared the man of the series award
collingwood batted aggressively at the start of the day scoring most of the
runs and taking most of the strike as he and kevin pietersen added runs in
minutes to the overnight total of for three
south african newcomer left arm fast bowler wayne parnell made the
breakthrough when pietersen chased wide delivery slanting away from him to
be caught behind by boucher for
it completed disappointing series for the south african born pietersen who
scored runs in four matches at an average of
ian bell made only five before he was morkel first victim of the day fending
sharply lifting delivery to jacques kallis at second slip
two balls later matt prior was out without scoring when an attempted hook looped
off top edge and graeme smith was able to run back from first slip to take the
catch
in morkel next over stuart broad gloved catch down the leg side to boucher
he was given not out by umpire steve davis but south africa successfully sought
review
swann batted with his customary aggression making off balls before he
edged an out swinger from dale steyn to ab de villiers at third slip
collingwood fighting innings ended when jp duminy was brought on to bowl his
off spinners his first ball was long hop which collingwood pulled straight to
morkel at deep backward square leg
collingwood made off balls with fours and six
duminy wrapped up the win when ryan sidebottom swung and missed to be bowled by
the fifth ball of the final over before lunch
rescuers cling to survivor hopes amid rising haiti toll
port au prince jan afp
rescue teams clawed through the rubble of port au prince for the fifth straight
day sunday clinging to desperate hopes that earthquake survivors will be found
even though bodies piled up and the united nations said it had never confronted
such disaster
amid new anger over the relief operations some haitians fought for the rations
that are getting through while others carried the injured on their backs or on
carts to emergency hospitals
the scale of the disaster is only just beginning to emerge in some cases
between and people died in the town of leogane west of the
capital and the epicentre of the magnitude quake which struck last tuesday
according to un officials
street after street of the town kilometers miles west of port au
prince was flattened
the medecins sans frontiers doctors without borders aid group opened an
emergency hospital at carrefour poor district near leogane msf emergency
coordinator hans van dillen said crowds arrived at the entrance almost
immediately
patients arrived on handcarts or on men backs there are other hospitals in
the area but they are already unable to cope with the number of injured and
have limited resources of personnel and medicines and equipment he added
msf said their doctors and surgeons had been working around the clock
amputating limbs and performing caesarian sections on pregnant women
with haitian government estimates of about dead and injured so
far backed up by un officials most bodies are now being pushed into mass graves
outside the capital to prevent the spread of disease while intensive efforts
are being pursued to find survivors
un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs spokeswoman elisabeth
byrs told afp that more than people had been pulled out alive from debris on
saturday dozen more than the previous day
we don give up hope to find more survivors stressed byrs the moral of the
rescue team is very high despite the hardship
some international teams comprising of rescue workers and dogs have
already scoured percent of the worst affected areas hit by the quake
byrs said the way buildings had collapsed left sufficient void spaces that
allow for trapped victims to remain alive
there is still hope the conditions are very favourable it exceptional and
thank god for that she said
but the united nations also warned over the scope of the work ahead we have
never been confronted with such disaster in the un memory it is like no
other byrs said on saturday
us helicopters crews unloaded boxes of vital supplies as massive queues formed
at distribution points where the un world food programme handed out high energy
food
an afp journalist saw one us helicopter dropping half dozen small cartons into
stadium of starving haitians some brandishing machetes as they fought over
the items
two dominicans were shot and seriously wounded as they handed out aid dominican
media reported carlos gatas and milton matos struggled back to the dominican
republic embassy with gunshot wounds after the apparent attack
the un said increasing numbers of haitians were trying to cross the border into
the dominican republic on the eastern side of hispaniola island and reported
surge of quake survivors fleeing to northern cities
secretary of state hillary clinton became the highest ranking us official to
visit haiti since the quake and highlighted the urgent need to clear logistical
hurdles
as president barack obama has said we will be here today tomorrow and for
the time ahead she told haitians
you have been severely tested but believe that haiti can come back even
stronger and better in the future
former us presidents bill clinton and george bush named by the white house
as special coordinators of aid to haiti vowed that the united states would not
abandon the stricken country
it long road to full recovery but we will not leave the haitian people to
walk it alone they wrote in commentary for the new york times
but we need more than just support from governments they argued we need the
innovation and resources of businesses the skills and the knowledge of
nongovernmental organizations including faith based groups and the generosity
and support of individuals to fill in the gaps
un secretary general ban ki moon was to visit haiti on sunday the un security
council will discuss coordination of the aid operation on monday

us drone strike kills in pakistan militant hideout
miranshah pakistan jan afp
us drone attack sunday killed militants in an area of pakistan northwest
tribal belt where local taliban chief hakimullah mehsud reportedly escaped death

the attack took place in shaktoi area kilometres miles southeast of

same spot where us missiles pounded an extremist hideout on thursday
that raid triggered rumours that mehsud had been killed or injured but the
chief of the tehreek taliban pakistan ttp released an audio message late
saturday denying rumours of his demise and vowing revenge for the us strikes
security officials said us drones appear to be tracking mehsud amid surge in
the strikes by unmanned spy planes sunday deadly bombing was the tenth us

the target was militant compound said security official in the area
twenty militant deaths have been confirmed
an intelligence official said that drone aircraft fired at least three missiles
while militants had ringed the demolished compound in the remote and mountainous
area and were digging out the bodies
the drones are apparently tracking and targeting pakistani taliban chief
hakimullah mehsud whose presence is frequently reported in the area he said
another security official who also asked not to be named because of the
sensitivity of the us strikes said it was too early to tell if any high value
militant targets were among the killed on sunday
mehsud released new audio recording on saturday to dispel rumours of his death
thursday which the military had said they were investigating the ttp said
mehsud left the site of the attack less than an hour beforehand
on the th of january am saying it again am alive am ok am not
injured when the drone strike took place was not present in the area at
that time mehsud said
if the drone attacks continue the ttp will not be responsible for any
dangerous steps in future the government of pakistan will be responsible
hakimullah mehsud assumed leadership of the ttp blamed for the deaths of
thousands of people in attacks across pakistan after his predecessor baitullah
mehsud was killed in us drone strike in august last year
since he took the reins of the ttp militant attacks against civilian and
security targets have surged on january more than people were killed in
suicide blast at volleyball game in northwest town
then on january hakimullah mehsud appeared in video clip alongside
jordanian who blew himself up on us military base in afghanistan last month
killing seven cia agents and his jordanian handler
the jordanian claimed the attack was to avenge the death of baitullah mehsud
and sources close to intelligence services say us efforts to track down
hakimullah mehsud had been stepped up since the cia bombing

hitting north waziristan bastion of al qaeda fighters the taliban and the
haqqani network which launches attacks on us and nato troops in afghanistan
more than people have been killed in about us drone strikes in pakistan
since august
washington is also pressing islamabad to tackle militants who use its soil to
launch attacks in neighbouring afghanistan as us president barack obama puts
pakistan at the heart of its fight against al qaeda and other militants
pakistan armed forces meanwhile last year carried out multiple assaults on
ttp strongholds across the tribal belt
unrest continues however and on sunday gunmen shot dead an anti taliban elder
in the tribal bajaur district officials said
