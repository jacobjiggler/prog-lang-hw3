kraft set to sweeten cadbury takeover bid reports
london jan afp
us food giant kraft foods will sweeten its takeover bid for british confectioner
cadbury this week according to media reports on sunday
the sunday times which did not cite its source said that kraft was putting the
finishing touches over the weekend to raising its billion pound
billion euro billion dollar offer
kraft will improve its bid from pence per share to at least pence on
monday according to the weekly paper which added that the us group would hike
the cash part of its offer to win around cadbury investors
the observer newspaper also reported on sunday that kraft was considering
offering an extra billion pounds in cash which would lift the bid to
pence the paper cited wall street sources
cadbury has repeatedly rejected kraft cash and shares offer which was
launched late last year and has denounced it as derisory
kraft had already raised the cash component earlier this month after selling
its north american pizza division to swiss rival nestle for billion dollars
tie up between kraft and cadbury would bring together leading kraft brands
like dairylea cheese kenco coffee and toblerone with the british group dairy
milk chocolate cadbury creme eggs and trident chewing gum
meanwhile potential takeover war was brewing after separate media report
suggested that us chocolate maker hershey was about to enter the fray
hershey plans to bid at least billion dollars this week for cadbury after
concluding it can top us food giant kraft offer the wall street journal
reported on friday
hershey was finalizing financing package that now includes loan of at least
billion dollars from banks five billion in new hershey shares and at least
three billion from private investors and the hershey trust the journal said
citing people familiar with the matter

iran mocks powers failure to agree sanctions as natural
tehran jan afp
iran said it was natural that world powers failed to reach decision about
new sanctions against the islamic republic over its nuclear drive state media
reported on sunday
the failure of the meeting is natural iranian foreign ministry spokesman
ramin mehmanparast was quoted as saying in report by the official irna news
agency
he was referring to new york meeting on saturday between the six world powers
in un backed talks on iran nuclear defiance made up of the five permanent
members of the un security council plus germany
the solution is for the group to recognise the islamic republic nuclear
rights and until they come up with realistic approach their meetings will
not have clear results mehmanparast added
he criticised the world powers for dealing with the issue politically
stressing the un international atomic energy agency did not see any deviation
in iran nuclear programme in its report
the statement came after senior european union official said saturday
closed door meeting of the world powers in new york reached no decision
the meeting brought together senior officials from britain france germany
russia and the united states
but china signaling its reluctance to back tougher sanctions pushed by the
west sent lower level diplomat winning praise from tehran
some nations like china do not believe that the negative approaches sanctions
threats and politically driven methods can bear any fruit mehmanparast said
washington and its western allies fear iran is secretly developing fissile
material for nuclear weapons under the cover of its uranium enrichment
programme tehran vehemently denies the charge
the six are concerned about tehran rejection of deal under which most of
iran low enriched uranium stockpile would be shipped abroad to be further
enriched into reactor fuel
punitive measures they are said to be considering include tougher sanctions
targeting iran insurance financial and arms sectors

pope failed assassin faces risk of army service after jail lawyer
ankara jan afp
mehmet ali agca the turk who attempted to kill pope john paul ii in may
face the prospect of military service following his release from jail monday
after almost three decades behind bars his lawyer said
military authorities in agca home town of malatya consider him draft dodger
and have said he should undergo medical check up immediately after his release
from high security prison in ankara haci ali ozhan told reporters sunday
agca was declared unfit for military service obligatory for turkish men
because of advanced anti social personality disorder when he was briefly
released from jail in and underwent check up at military hospital
the ministry of defence says it has not approved this report we are demanding
that this error be corrected by monday morning ozhan said
otherwise he explained agca will be taken to an army recruitment office
following his release and then if necessary to military hospital
agca is in shock and insists he cannot hold weapon because of his religious
and philosophical convictions ozhan said voicing concern over agca safety
if he is to be recruited to the army
the authorities had released agca in january amid legal mix up but re
arrested him after eight days when court ruled that reductions to his jail
term under amnesty laws and penal code amendments had been miscalculated
he was year old militant of the notorious far right grey wolves on the run
from turkish justice when he resurfaced in saint peter square in rome on may
and opened fire on the pope leaving him seriously wounded
his motive remains mystery charges that the soviet union and then communist
bulgaria were behind the assassination plot were never proved

voting starts in cliffhanger chilean presidential poll
santiago jan afp
voting started sunday in chilean presidential election that promised to be an
extremely tight contest between conservative billionaire sebastian pinera
and former leftist president eduardo frei
voter intention surveys ahead of sunday knockout second round between the two
candidates suggested technical dead heat with results too close to predict
outgoing president michelle bachelet who cannot stand for another term under
chile constitution has thrown her full weight behind frei bid turning his
fortunes around to pinera chagrin
in the first round of the election held december pinera emerged with
percentage point lead over frei
that margin was now seen to have shrunk to just percentage points less
than the survey margin for error
polls were to close at pm gmt with first official results expected
three hours later
some million people are eligible to vote in chile one of latin america

if victory goes to pinera it would signal an end to the leftwing rule enjoyed
over the past two decades by bachelet four party concertacion coalition which
has been in power since the end of general augusto pinochet dictatorship in
pinera media magnate and big stakeholder in chile flagship lan airline had
been confident of beating frei an uncharismatic politician who was head of
state from to until bachelet managed to turn the tide
the current president enjoys skyhigh popularity ratings after rolling out
well received social welfare program and successfully guiding chile recovery
through last year global financial crisis
she has been leveraging that support squaring it behind frei member of the
christian democratic party whose father eduardo frei montalva was also
president of chile between and
the fruit of her efforts was seen in survey wednesday which showed pinera with
percent of intended ballots and frei with percent
pinera was bitter that is margin for victory had been so dramatically reduced
it abusive what the government has done to use and abuse public money
public institutions and even public employees the interfering campaign it
done is not fair and is not clean pinera complained in radio interview on
friday
pinera was especially nettled by comment made by bachelet on thursday that she
would vote for frei because he was honest
the message bachelet was pushing was clear that pinera multiple business
interests made him less than ideal candidate to run chile vibrant economy
pinera camp has tried to counter by portraying the tycoon as somebody who
knows how to generate wealth not just for himself but for the nation
nevertheless it was clear whatever advantage he had has evaporated and sunday
contest could go either way
we are seeing very content frei and an insecure pinera who for the first
time is realizing that he can lose the presidential vote runoff political

abbas urges endgame if israel does not freeze settlements
ramallah west bank jan afp
palestinian president mahmud abbas urged washington on sunday to declare an
endgame to resolve the decades old middle east conflict if israel does not
agree to halt settlement growth
abbas said in statement carried by the official wafa wire service that arab
states and the palestinians would present unified position to the united
states offering two options
either israel adheres to complete halt to settlements and the guidelines of
negotiations or america must come and say this is the endgame with respect to
determining borders and the refugee issue and other final status issues
abbas has resisted months of us pressure to relaunch peace talks suspended
during last year devastating gaza war saying israel must first freeze all
settlement activity in the occupied west bank including annexed arab east
jerusalem
in november israel hawkish prime minister benjamin netanyahu enacted
month moratorium on new building starts in the west bank but excluded east
jerusalem public buildings and projects already under way
the united states hailed the move as unprecedented but the palestinians have
slammed it as insufficient
last week abbas appeared to give some ground by demanding halt to settlement
growth for fixed period but in sunday statement he remained adamant about
complete halt
we cannot return to the negotiations if israel stays with this position abbas
said referring to the limited moratorium
us middle east envoy george mitchell is expected to return to the region this
week to try again to convince both sides to restart negotiations
