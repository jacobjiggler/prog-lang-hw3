juncker bids to revamp eurozone governance
brussels jan afp
the newly returned head of the eurozone vowed on monday to revamp its economic
governance as market pressure triggered by ballooning greek debt spiralled
fresh from being re elected to represent the economic interests of the
countries that share the decade old currency luxembourg premier jean claude
juncker spelled out four key changes he wants to implement
we will need to concentrate our efforts on structural politics linked to
respective competitiveness of member states throughout the eurozone he warned
in reference to huge imbalances in economic productivity brought sharply into
focus during the recession
it not question of adding bureaucratic layers but of adding value to our
economy juncker told his closing press conference
the changes involve budgetary coordination with tightened rules sought on
adherence to bloc rules on deficits and other economic indicators greater
surveillance in order to gradually even out imbalances international
representation for the eurozone in the group of major economies in
particular and more rigorous examination of candidates to enter the currency
zone
with recession having laid bare massive discrepancies between national eurozone
economies juncker in tray is arguably busier than at any time since he first
took the grouping reins in years after taking power at home
seemingly impenetrable deficit problems in athens have left markets asking tough
questions of the eurozone prospects as summed up neatly earlier on monday by
simon derrick an analyst at bny mellon
with rising concerns about the workability of the greek government stability
and growth plan the firm rejection from within the eurozone of the idea of
bailout the rapidly rising cost of default insurance on greek sovereign debt
and concerns over deficits elsewhere in the region the problems for the
single currency are mounting rapidly he said
can understand why the markets aren convinced yet dutch finance minister
wouter bos admitted going into the meeting
we should enable the greeks to show the markets that they know what they re
doing that it not just going to be beautiful words
ireland portugal and spain should also be encouraged to show that they are
aware of their own responsibilities to get their finances in order bos warned
as cracks began to appear among peers
however after hearing the latest from athens juncker insisted that greece is
in uniquely bad way
analysts have speculated that greece might need european union or
international monetary fund bailout with the cost of borrowing money having
skyrocketed and some even suggesting that eurozone exclusion lies ahead
all told the result is clearly more cautious approach to euro area
enlargement with juncker adding that member states wanting in have to realise
that the journey can be stressful there have to be long term efforts
juncker policy progress may not move as rapidly as he wishes with franco
spanish move to promote such stronger central economic governance opposed by
germany which fears for the independence of the european central bank in
frankfurt decision on who will be the european central bank next deputy
governor was meanwhile put back until next month
eu ministers are due on tuesday morning to discuss an overhaul of bloc savings
tax rules with pressure growing on juncker luxembourg to drop its long
cherished banking secrecy laws

thousands of people who have been without steady source of food or water since
the quake struck

pathways but the huge undertaking was expected to take weeks if not months

becomes one of the highest profile victims yet of the country long economic
malaise

canadian terror plotter sentenced to life in prison
ottawa jan afp
the ring leader of group of alleged islamic extremists accused of plotting
to bomb canada main bourse and other targets was sentenced on monday to life
in prison
zakaria amara received life sentence for his role in terrorist plot to
bomb toronto the public prosecution service of canada said in statement
he also he was sentenced to nine years for his participation in terrorist
group to be served concurrently
the sentence is the stiffest punishment imposed in the conspiracy and under
canada anti terrorism laws which parliament passed in the wake of
attacks on the united states
amara may however be eligible for parole in less than seven years after having
already served time in prison awaiting trial
what this case revealed was spine chilling said justice bruce durno in court
his remarks cited by the globe and mail newspapers
it cannot be said these things happen only in other countries he said these
things happen here
zakaria last week apologized to canadians for his actions in an open letter he
read in court
deserve nothing less than your complete contempt he said in his first
public remarks
the mastermind of an al qaeda inspired plot to bomb the toronto stock exchange
canada spy agency offices and military base using fertilizer explosives
packed in rented trucks said his interpretation of islam was naive and
gullible
but his outlook changed in the years he spent in prison awaiting trial he said
amara sunni muslim explained he befriended jewish inmate and shia muslim
who helped turn him around as well as banker who once worked in the toronto
stock exchange building
when someone shows me wrong he said willing to accept it
but ontario superior court justice durno ruled amara did not just commit
criminal offence he committed terrorist offence that would have had
catastrophic consequences he did not serve as foot soldier but as leader
earlier co conspirator saad gaya was sentenced to years in prison for
his role in the foiled bomb plot aimed at provoking canadian withdrawal
from afghanistan
gaya pleaded guilty to the terrorism charges in september
another of the plotters is currently on trial while charges against seven others
were dropped and five still face trial
they were arrested during police sting operation in and charged with
participating in terrorist group and attempting to cause an explosion
specifically they aimed to acquire explosive substances and cause an explosion
or explosions for religiously inspired political purposes said court documents
in the gaya case
members of the group allegedly sought to purchase three tonnes of the bomb
making ingredient ammonium nitrate from undercover police officers who had
switched it with an inert substance
gaya motivation was to pressure canada into withdrawing troops from
afghanistan the religious aspect being to protect muslim country from
attack said prosecutors
his lawyer paul slansky told reporters after his sentencing terrorism is
terrible and heinous crime but not everyone that commits heinous and evil
crime is themselves evil
do believe that he was misguided youth who made some seriously erroneous
mistakes in deciding to trust these people who were themselves misguided he
said

no plans for policing role for us troops in haiti gates
aboard us military aircraft jan afp
us troops in quake hit haiti will play supporting role for un peacekeeping
forces and will not take on broader policing mission defense secretary robert
gates said on monday
think we still see the un and minustah in the lead here gates said
referring to the united nations contingent in haiti
we are there in support of them and the government of haiti he told reporters
on his plane bound for india
the more than us ground troops deployed to haiti after last week
earthquake will help safeguard relief efforts but gates appeared to rule out
wider peacekeeping operation
haven heard of us playing policing role at any point he said
amid tensions and looting in the aftermath of the massive quake gates said
maintaining security was high priority
after all we can deliver the food and water if we don have reasonable
security situation he said
he added that american troops had the authority to use force to defend
themselves or others if necessary
think obviously anywhere we deploy our troops they have the authority and the
right to defend themselves and they also have the right to defend innocent
haitians and also members of the international community if they see something
happening
he said there was risk of violence erupting if emergency aid did not reach
earthquake survivors
until we can get ample supplies of food and water to people there is worry
that in their desperation some will turn to violence and we will work with the
un in trying to ensure the security situation remains good he said
president barack obama has mobilized major us military relief operation in
haiti including brigade from the us army nd airborne division and the
nd marine expeditionary unit along with an array of ships transport planes
and helicopters
