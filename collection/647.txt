football mancini plays down talk of robinho rift
manchester england jan afp
manchester city manager roberto mancini insisted he had not fallen out with
robinho after bringing him off the bench only to substitute him during last
weekend defeat by everton
saturday premier league loss at goodison park was mancini first since he
became city manager
after roque santa cruz suffered recurrence of hamstring injury just four
minutes into the match on merseyside mancini brought on robinho
however the brazilian british record million pounds signing was
himself replaced by shaun wright phillips early in the second half
robinho has been widely criticised for failing to produce the goods for city
away from home and there have been several reports in the british media the club
are looking to sell him if not now then at the end of the season
mancini tried to dismiss such speculation although the way in which he compared
robinho to in form city striker carlos tevez did little to bolster the
brazilian case
it was bad night for us all mancini said monday robinho can play well but
it is not always possible and on saturday he played the same as his team mates
when put wright phillips on had to take striker off because cannot keep
five forwards on the pitch
had to decide between robinho and carlos
mancini added he robinho is good man good player
city italian manager was speaking ahead of tuesday league cup semi final
first leg against manchester united at eastlands
mancini added he wanted city who haven won major trophy since but are
now bankrolled by wealthy abu dhabi based owner sheikh mansour to be as big
club as united
the red devils may have won league titles alone since the premier league was
formed in but there are concerns among the old trafford faithful about the
club ability to remain competitive while labouring under vast debts built up
by their american owners the glazer family
if we work well it is possible said mancini about the prospect of city
rivalling united
he added united have big history they have been good team for many years
city can become big team in the next year it is most important that we get
into the top four and so qualify for the champions league
mancini was the manager of italian giants inter who vie for local supremacy
with city rivals ac milan and he said there was no reason why manchester could
not have two teams at the top of english football as was last the case in the
late
surely it would be better if city were also big club in the future because
then manchester could have two clubs in the champions league he said
and he insisted united financial worries would be an irrelevance come
tuesday kick off
manchester united have been on the top for many years he said it is not
important if they have problems
on pitch there are only players not money

architects blame shoddy steel concrete for haiti destruction
port au prince jan afp
poor quality concrete and steel explains the extent of quake devastation in
port au prince team from the emergency architects foundation said after three
days in the haitian capital
architects patrick coulombel and serge guno said they have visited over key
buildings to assess their structural soundness since tuesday quake which
levelled much of port au prince
the city french secondary school was given the thumbs up and so could be used
as field hospital while group of journalists were evacuated from hotel
after their apparently unaffected room was deemed unsafe
our dread is of aftershocks coulombel told afp adding that all collapsed or
risky buildings shared the same problem shoddy steel reinforced bars known as
rebars and bad quality concrete surrounding them
the rebars are soft you can bend them with your hand and they re smooth while
good rebars should be ridged as for the concrete the proportion of cement is
wrong and there the bad quality of the aggregate said coulombel
to save money people use bad steel less cement and then the concrete it
very technical and complicated to make here people aren able to create good
quality concrete he said
coulombel said certain building shapes are less prone to collapse than others
and recommends pyramid shapes where possible even though he admitted people
don necessarily want to live in pyramid

tehran jan afp
foreign minister manouchehr mottaki on monday confirmed iran consul general in
oslo has resigned but said tehran did not accept his resignation and still
considers him ministry employee
mohammed reza heydari has resigned but it has not been accepted and he must
continue his work either there or in the ministry and he has been informed of
this decision mottaki told reporters in tehran
on january heydari said he had quit his job in protest at tehran violent
suppression of opposition demonstrations on december adding that he would
not return to iran for fear of repercussions
the iranian embassy denied he had resigned insisting the consul term had
simply come to an end about month ago
in reaction to mottaki comments monday heydari stood his ground and excluded
returning to tehran for fear of reprisals
am diplomat and everyone knows what happens to diplomat if he turns his
back on regime such as the one in place in iran he told afp in oslo
returning to tehran would be putting my life and my family at risk he said
through an interpreter
heydari said he would only return to iran if the opposition prevailed in his
country
if not will continue fighting in exile for human rights alongside groups
that defend freedom he said
have worked with mr mottaki and have respect for him but my message to him
is clear he has to look around him and become aware of what is happening he
has to resign and fight alongside his people not against his people he added
the opposition protests on december coinciding with the shiite holy day of
ashura left at least eight people dead and hundreds of others either injured or
imprisoned

been stationed in oslo for just over two years he was unsure when asked if he
