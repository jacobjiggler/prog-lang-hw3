football injures take shine off arsenal title bid
london jan afp
arsenal bid to win the english premier league title threatens to be derailed
by lengthening injury list with manager arsene wenger currently without nine
first team players
striker robin van persie ankle and johan djourou knee seem set to miss the
rest of the season but there are growing number of players at the emirates who
have shorter term injury problems

who were both injured in training before sunday victory away to bolton
win that moved the gunners to within three points of leaders and london rivals
chelsea
both ramsey and nasri are set to be out for three weeks each and will be among
the arsenal players missing from wednesday hoem match against bolton where
victory would see the gunners go top of the table on goal difference
nasri injury is what call day injury it is clean hamstring
injury said wenger
ramsey absence will be the same but it is not hamstring injury it is
thigh
arsenal are optimistic though that left back kieran gibbs foot and midfielder
jack wilshere hamstring during tough run of matches that see wenger men up
against aston villa manchester united chelsea and liverpool in successive
fixtures
we have little chance to get denilson abdomen and theo walcott rib back
for wednesday and to get nicklas bendtner recovering from hernia surgery back

have repeatedly rebuffed any efforts at negotiation
the last major attack on the capital was on december when suicide car
bomber blew up his vehicle outside the homes of former senior government

chelsea star midfielder misses the final group game in luanda after injuring
his right knee in training on saturday

results of the scan back and the coach has confirmed that michael will
definitely miss tuesday game
it was unclear how serious this latest setback was and whether essien might
recover in time to play any further role in ghana nations cup campaign should
they progress to the last eight
ghana are one point behind burkina faso and the four time champions need win
to avoid being eliminated after the first round of the biennial african football

side already ravaged by injury
with raft of key players missing the black stars fell to competition
favourites ivory coast in their opening game with coach milovan rajevac having
to field largely inexperienced side
fully fit essien would have given ghana strength and experience in midfield
against burkina faso side that was good enough to hold the ivory coast to
goalless draw in their opening group game
essien who arrived in angola late for the tournament because snow delayed his
flight from london has been struggling to recover from hamstring injury
sustained playing for chelsea in the champions league last month
he was kept on the bench until half time against ivory coast last friday in
cabinda to avoid aggravating the injury and his second half presence on the
pitch could not prevent loss
this new injury is completely unconnected to his previous problem and represents
cruel twist of fate for the ghana international
