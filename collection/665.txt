yushchenko orange hero who lost his shine
kiev jan afp
his face pock marked from poisoning ukraine president upon being elected in
december stood before tens of thousands of supporters in kiev as the
embodiment of their hopes for better future
inaugurated as ukraine third president after the orange revolution street
protests reversed the results of rigged polls triumphant viktor yushchenko
vowed to end corruption implement reform and bring the country into the eu
but he ended sunday first round presidential polls in humiliating fifth
place unceremoniously exiting his bid for re election with just five percent of
the vote amid widespread disappointment with the revolution failure to bring
real change
what went wrong for man hailed as hero five years ago
rather than concentrating on ukrainians desires for improving day to day
government efficiency and ending corruption yushchenko saw his presidency as
grandiose historical mission to place the country at the heart of europe
as he set out goal for the ex soviet state to join nato relations with russia
plunged to their worst level since the country won independence from moscow in
he spent much energy on historical issues close to his heart insisting that the
deaths from starvation of several million ukrainians in the under soviet
dictator joseph stalin should be recognized as genocide
such focus was hardly surprising from the former central bank chief who shows
an interest bordering on obsession in ukraine heritage and makes point of
climbing its highest mountain hoverla every year
as ukrainian politics lurched from one crisis to another the urgent challenges
facing the country were left unanswered
yushchenko attention was diverted by bitter personal row with his one time
ally turned nemesis prime minister yulia tymoshenko in bickering divorce
that vividly illustrated the rupture of the revolution
stuck in bitter power struggle over the right to be ukraine true number one
the pair exchanged daily insults and accused one another of being criminally
responsible for wrecking the country
such hatred meant yushchenko spent the election campaign seeking to destroy her
character and dredge up muck from her past ironically boosting the campaign of
his defeated rival pro russia candidate viktor yanukovich
yushchenko biggest achievement was to get elected in the first place his
first big mistake was then not to govern as he campaigned said ukraine expert
andrew wilson of the european council on foreign relations
yushchenko main interests outside work are said to be bee keeping and
collecting ukrainian folk art and he adopted an aloof pose of intellectual
superiority in the chaotic world of ukrainian politics
am not politician am an economist do not like politics he said as
the campaign ended describing himself as black sheep he has yet to comment
on the results
the poisoning that ravaged yushchenko face was initially blamed on agents
working for russia
with the case still mysteriously under investigated his supporters and several
medical experts have blamed deliberate dioxin poisoning while others insist on
natural explanation his face has now largely recovered
ecb announces end to swiss franc loans
frankfurt jan afp
the european central bank said monday that improved money market conditions
would allow it to halt swiss franc loans to commercial banks
the ecb along with the national banks of hungary poland and switzerland on
january will suspend so called swap operations that provided banks with swiss
francs in exchange for euros
demand for liquidity provided by this type of operation has declined and
conditions in the swiss franc funding market have improved statement issued
by the swiss national bank explained
the ecb began to loan swiss francs in november to ease tension on money
markets that erupted after the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed
many eastern european commercial banks had extended credit to clients in that
currency and were squeezed when rise in its value sparked widespread loan
defaults
the ecb meanwhile is also slowly withdrawing other exceptional measures taken to
ensure interbank credit markets were amply supplied with cash as the global
financial crisis eases
tourism in haiti caribbean should rebound from quake unwto
madrid jan afp
the tourist industry in haiti and in the caribbean in general should not
suffer any long term effects from the country devastating earthquake the head
of the un world tourism organisation said monday
we do not expect much long term effects in terms of tourism taleb rifai said
we have seen cases like this in other parts of the world in the past such as
the indian ocean tsunami and other natural disasters
the effects of course will be immediate but our experience shows that the
recovery in these situations becomes quick in terms of the public perception
said the head of the madrid based unwto
he said the effect on haiti would be in more in regard to tourist
infrastructure
for the caribbean as whole we do not think it will have long lasting
effect
we think that in the public mind and the public perception the attitude of
solidarity toward haiti is powerful to the extent that it would probably be able
to stand up on its feet the country in particular and the region in general
magnitude earthquake on wednesday flattened much of the impoverished
caribbean nation where bodies have been buried in mass graves and
international aid workers are struggling to cope with the scale of the crisis
rifai was speaking at news conference in madrid to announce the unwto annual
world tourism barometer
the report said tourism in the caribbean region returned to growth in the last
four months of although arrivals were down percent in the americas as

suu kyi lawyers give final arguments in top myanmar court
yangon jan afp
myanmar supreme court heard final arguments on monday against the extended
house arrest of detained pro democracy icon aung san suu kyi her lawyer said
the year old opposition leader was ordered in august to spend another
months in detention after being convicted over an incident in which us man
swam to her house lower court rejected an initial appeal in october
monday hearing at the top yangon court where both sides gave arguments
lasted more than three hours according to suu kyi main lawyer kyi win he
said decision was expected within month
we expect them to accept our arguments and after that release daw aung san suu
kyi he told afp daw is term of respect in myanmar
the law is completely on our side he said adding that they argued her
conviction was unlawful because it was based on regulations in the country
now defunct constitution
if the appeal is rejected suu kyi and her legal team will write to the office
of the chief justice at the supreme court explained nyan win another of her
lawyers
if this also fails it is thought they would have to appeal directly to the
military government to try to get the conviction overturned
the nobel peace laureate who is detained at her lakeside mansion in yangon did
not attend the court and journalists were barred although the british
ambassador and another embassy official were seen going into the hearing
myanmar military rulers have kept suu kyi in detention for of the past
years having refused to recognise her party landslide victory in the
country last democratic elections in
the extension of her detention after prison trial sparked international
outrage as it effectively keeps her off the stage for elections promised by the
regime some time this year
but in recent months the united states followed by the european union has
shifted towards policy of greater engagement with myanmar which has been
under military rule since as sanctions have failed to bear fruit
suu kyi has also changed tack after years of favouring harsh international
measures against myanmar writing twice to junta chief than shwe since september
offering her cooperation in trying to get western sanctions lifted
on friday she met the ruling junta liaison officer in the latest sign of
dialogue between the two sides it was the fourth meeting between the pair since
the beginning of october
she was also granted meeting in december with three elderly senior nld
members at which she asked for their approval to reorganise the party
leadership committee
but the junta has not yet granted her requests to meet the rest of the committee
and to hold talks with than shwe himself
in november the regime allowed her to make rare appearance in front of the
media after meeting us assistant secretary of state kurt campbell the highest
level official from washington to visit myanmar for years
visit by us senator jim webb in august secured the release of john yettaw the
american man who swam across lake to suu kyi home in may and sparked the
case that led to her detention being prolonged

employees had been transferred to the hong kong office while others remained in
beijing but basically have nothing to do

of internet censors by filtering search results available on google cn but is
still seeking talks with the chinese government on solution
the united states has asked for an explanation from beijing and the state
department said friday that formal request would be made in the coming days
it will express our concern for this incident and request information from
china as to an explanation of how it happened and what they plan to do about
