football africa cup of nations group scenarios
luanda jan afp
africa cup of nations quarter finals line up without four time champions
ghana would have been unthinkable few months ago
but the absence from the starting line up of eight first choices including
chelsea midfielder michael essien resulted in loss to ivory coast and
they must fight for survival against burkina faso tuesday
here are the scenarios facing the three teams left in group after togo
withdrew following deadly ambush on their bus convoy as it arrived in the
restive northern enclave of cabinda from congo brazzaville
ivory coast
the title favourites have completed their schedule and will finish first and
stay in cabinda for quarter final against the group runners up unless
burkina faso defeat ghana by at least three goals or by two goals and score four
or more times
burkina faso
win or draw against ghana and the stallions enter the quarter finals at the
expense of the world cup qualifiers judged by their ultra cautious but
impressive showing when shutting out chelsea striker didier drogba and his
ivorians the outsiders have chance of doing just that
ghana
the situation is clearcut for the black stars win or pack their bags and
head home in disgrace after failing to survive group they were expected to
cruise through with ivory coast in defence of serb coach milovan rajevac
injuries have wreaked havoc with his plans

football ghana sweat on essien for must win nations cup game
luanda jan afp
no calculators are needed to work out the task facing ghana in tuesday final
group game win and nothing else is required against burkina faso if the
four time champions are to make it through to the africa cup of nations quarter
finals
the black stars are sweating on the results of scan to the injured knee of
michael essien player of such influence that his absence could make or break
their cup campaign
essien who only played bit part in his country opening loss to ivory
coast hobbled out of training session on sunday and was taken to hospital for
tests
ghana media officer randy abbey told afp michael suffered right knee
injury in the training session this morning
he was taken to local hospital for scan and we ll get the results back
tomorrow and then have clearer idea of whether he can play
essien absence would be colossal blow to ghana who face burkina faso at the
seat november stadium in the angolan capital
ghana are one point behind burkina faso who put themselves in sound position
to qualify when coming away from their opening game against ivory coast with
goalless draw and precious point
essien arrived in angola late for the tournament because snow delayed his flight
from london and has been struggling to recover from hamstring injury sustained
playing for chelsea in the champions league last month
he was kept on the bench until half time against ivory coast last friday in
cabinda by serb coach milovan rajevac to avoid aggravating the injury and his
second half presence on the pitch could not prevent heavy defeat
ghana arrived in angola with raft of key players missing forcing rajevac to
field largely inexperienced side
of the burkina faso test he said our next match is question of double or
quits
rajevac suggested the lopsided scoreline against the ivory coast did not do his
side justice
we didn play as badly as the score suggests most of the time we played well
but unfortunately we didn get the breaks
after essien training setback it looks as though lady luck has yet to smile on
the first team from africa to qualify for the world cup
burkina faso set out defensive stall against the ivory coast and the ploy
worked treat as european based stars like didier drogba and kolo toure were
held at bay
burkian faso coach paulo duarte said that goalless drew has allowed us to
start thinking of qualifying for the last eight now we have to take on another
world cup qualifer in ghana but my team has the ability to put up good
performance
togo the other country drawn in group withdrew before the tournament kicked
off last sunday after the bus convoy carrying them into angola was attacked in
the restive northern angolan enclave of cabinda

jal shares fall to all time low of five us cents
tokyo jan afp
japan airlines shares plunged to an all time low of just five us cents monday on
the eve of an expected bankruptcy filing by the carrier which is crippled by
massive debts
jal shares slid two yen or percent to five yen five us cents by early
afternoon as investors bailed out ahead of an announcement tuesday on state
backed restructuring package for the troubled airline
the market value of the once venerable carrier now stands at just million
dollars less than the cost of one new jumbo jet
while the government has pledged to do its utmost to ensure the airline keeps
flying during restructuring equity investors are expected to lose most or all
of their money if the company files for bankruptcy
in the meantime many short term speculators are trading the shares to try to
make quick profit dealers said
this has become pure money game said masatoshi sato strategist at mizuho
investors securities there is really no meaning to the level of the shares
jal stock has plunged percent over the past three months its highest share
price since it began merging operations with small domestic carrier japan air
systems was yen seen in
jal which lost about billion dollars in the six months to september has
already received an emergency loan from state backed bank and is seeking more
public aid in the face of mounting debts
according to japanese media the company is set to receive an injection of
government funds worth several hundred billion yen several billion dollars
under turnaround plan that would see it file for bankruptcy
at the same time jal creditor banks are expected to be asked to forgive loans
worth several hundred billion yen
the airline is reportedly set to slash more than jobs and sell non core
assets such as hotels to stem massive losses
claws out over air new zealand cougar ad
wellington jan afp
air new zealand has drawn the ire of rape prevention group over competition
aimed at cougars middle aged women who prefer younger men
the airline is offering tickets for next month wellington sevens rugby
tournament to older women who prefer their meat rare
the competition invites packs of up to four cougars to send in their
photographs to the airline to gain chance of winning the tickets
an accompanying youtube video parodying wildlife documentaries says cougars are
known for living off sparse vegetation during the day and large slabs of meat at
night
it goes on to show herd of young males gathering at watering hole or pub
while the cougar waits to pounce on any straggler that separates itself from the
herd
eventually the young male is dragged off to the cougar inner city apartment
where it will cruelly be made to listen to enya or the eurythmics
the campaign manager duane perrott said air new zealand had been overwhelmed
by competition entries and positive feedback on good bit of light hearted
humour
but the rape prevention education organisation said the advert was appalling and
degrading to women
my question is why is our national carrier promoting sexually predatory
behaviour director kim mcgregor told monday new zealand herald
we have also had complaints from male survivors who have been raped by women
and they are very distressed that their situation is being laughed at and made
out to be humorous
air new zealand is no stranger to attention grabbing campaigns aiming to spice
up its in flight safety films the carrier last year began featuring videos of
male and female staff naked except for body paint uniforms
an earlier ad featuring staff including chief executive rob fyfe in body
paint said air new zealand had nothing to hide about its fares in contrast to
what it called the deceptive pricing of low cost carriers

australian media crews pull baby from rubble in haiti
sydney jan afp
rival australian news crews said monday that saving life came before doing
their jobs when they rescued an month old baby from underneath the rubble in
earthquake devastated haiti
the little girl was lying alongside the bodies of her dead parents who were
killed in the magnitude earthquake which hit port au prince on january
when the camera crews heard her moans and began to dig her out on friday

and lifted pieces of concrete out of the way while nine interpreter and fixer
deiby celestino climbed into the tangled mess to retrieve the child

the dusty little girl and giving her water
that moment it was beyond news amor said haven seen anything so
remarkable since the birth of my own child the emotion for all of us has been
incredible
amor said the news crews and the locals who had helped locate the girl were
concentrated on rescuing the child rather than news priorities
the focus of everybody on that hill was the little girl and as any of us will
tell you it was deiby who went into that hole and dug and dug until he got
that little girl out he the hero he told the australian

bring out the very worst in journalists they can also produce the best

their own safety and placed their personal convictions before professional
pressures he said in statement to afp
yes they put down their camera to help but they also filed their story and

tennis sharapova becomes open first major casualty
melbourne jan afp
former champion maria sharapova became the first major casualty of the
australian open when she lost three and half hour epic to fellow russian
maria kirilenko on monday
downcast sharapova offered no excuses for the first round
loss saying she had her chances but could not take them
the two year olds slugged it out for three desperately close sets before
sharapova forehand sailed wide giving kirilenko the first upset of the
tournament and her second win against the former world number one
certainly had my chances and just didn execute sharapova said
you know felt like was when she was up and then get back there
back in the game just didn take advantage of that and let her control the
situation again
my game was just up and down in many areas and it just finished at the down
level
sharapova who spent almost year out of the game in following surgery
for shoulder injury looked rusty at the start with many of her groundstrokes
either hitting the net or spraying long or wide often both
the champion elected not to play competitive lead up tournament instead
choosing exhibitions in hong kong and thailand and her lack of serious match
practice was evident
both women started nervously dropping their opening serves following string
of unforced errors
sharapova recovered first and took control but kirilenko soon found her range
and came back into the match taking the first set in tiebreak
sharapova came out firing in the second attacking more serving better and
reducing her error rate
she broke kirilenko to lead and held the advantage in tightly contested
second set leveling the match at one set apiece
but the effort appeared to take its toll and tired looking sharapova lost her
opening serve in the third set as kirilenko eased to lead
sharapova refused to concede and when nervous kirilenko served for the match
at she pounced and broke back to put the set back on serve
but the respite was only fleeting as kirilenko brought up two match points on
sharapova serve
while she saved the first she couldn save the second and kirilenko was
through
kirilenko said she knew she was in with great chance of causing an upset
midway through the second set
in the first set was little bit late she was playing so aggressive and
kind of made defensive play the world number said
and then started to feel much better in the second set actually
started to feel that can be aggressive as well hit more winners than in
first set
and from that point started to feel that yeah playing good from the
baseline and can beat her
sharapova refused to blame her shoulder injury for the loss
it the first tournament of the year and just came up against somebody that
just played really good tennis she said
that just the way it goes mean could be disappointed or could just
take it as it is and just go back on the court and just keep working

where the walls have become sarcophagus for so many without scratch on him
un firefighter neville fouche expressed his amazement at the rescue five days
after the earthquake how is it possible it is simply miracle he said
ban said the three top priorities were to save as many people as possible to
bring emergency humanitarian aid in the form of water food and medication and
to coordinate the massive aid effort
the un has noted that at least local government structures remained after the
tsunami hit indonesia aceh province but in the haiti town of leogane
for example all public services were lost in the earthquake
between and people are thought to have died in that town alone an
indication of the horrific scale of the catastrophe beyond port au prince

in mass graves and was declaring state of emergency until the end of the
month
ban came face to face with the human toll when he toured makeshift tent city
of people which has sprung up on the open air champs de mars square next

we need food we need shelter we need work angry and frustrated haitians
shouted
ban urged them to be patient saying help was coming and warned against

ban has sent edmond mulet top un peacekeeping official and annabi
predecessor to port au prince to take charge of minustah in an interim
capacity
later he and mulet took part in ceremony to remember the un dead and in
sad symbolic move ban was handed the flag from the un headquarters to take back
to new york with him
the united nations on friday appealed for million dollars from the world
community to help three million quake victims in the western hemisphere
poorest country for the next six months
the money is to be used for urgently needed food water and sanitation medical
supplies tents and blankets logistics and education

urge the international community to aid the island nation after it was battered
by hurricanes the previous year

of melbourne park for unruly behaviour and another group banned from entering
the rowdy crowd gathered on court six and were ejected after standing on chairs

one supporter was found carrying two flares
security guards marched the troublemakers from the grounds of the opening grand
slam of the season with the help of police
earlier in the day around chanting croats lit flares and made offensive and
threatening gestures as they headed enmasse to the tournament
the herald sun newspaper said one of its photographers was spat on and punched
as he photographed the mob
victoria state police superintendent jock menzel denied security had failed by
allowing the flares to be smuggled into the complex
security processes and procedures are very tight you must understand people
are innovative and they will go to great lengths to smuggle contraband into the
particular venue it does happen quite frequently he said
menzel added that police assisted security staff in ejecting karlovic
supporters who have been banned for the rest of the tournament
these people were disruptive they were standing on seats and they were
causing problems for the other spectators who were there to watch the game he
said
tennis australia and victoria police we won tolerate poor behaviour and
we ve demonstrated that
we re here to set standard our mission is to make sure the event occurs in
happy and safe way and that people are safe and we re going to make sure that
occurs
