sprint pursuit massed start and relay
what do the names mean
in the individual event competitors start one at time every seconds on
loop course between each loop athletes stop four times at the shooting
range if an athlete misses shot one minute is added to their total time the
sprint is three laps of shorter loop course and each miss means an athlete
must cover an extra metres in the pursuit the winner of the sprint event
being chased down by their rivals who have staggered starts depending on their
sprint times miss means an extra metres
the massed start sounds like recipe for pile up
it is all organised so the top athletes start together and visit the
shooting range four times each miss costs an extra metres if competitor
is lapped during the competition they must withdraw and the winner is the first
across the line
what about the relay
each member of four person team skis leg and tags the next team member
when they finish instead of the usual five shots each athlete is allowed an
extra three bullets miss costs each athlete metres and the first
athlete over the line wins for their team
can imagine it not doping free and the training must be intense
like all endurance sports it is prone to doping as the gap between success
and failure can be less than second biathletes will train two and half
hours at time and up to or more sessions per week they will ski up to
kilometres biathletes often use swimming to help practicing breathing control
for when they are on the shooting range
hope emerges from the ruins of haiti supermarket
port au prince jan afp
hello said the rescuer simple greeting that belied the enormity of the
moment as maria ariel and lamy were pulled from the debris after surviving more
than hours under the rubble living off supermarket food
the trio could not know it but the torturous route to their salvation after
haiti catastrophic earthquake had begun two days earlier thanks to text
message sent to the united nations
someone sent text message saying they were inside the caribbean market near
the fruit meat and frozen food aisles said joseph fernandez of south florida
urban search and rescue
the five story supermarket packed with people was just one speck on
the horizon of rubble that awaited rescuers from the united states turkey and
scores of other nations
but with the aid of that text message ultra sensitive microphones and dogged
perseverance engineers rescuers and other experts were able to hunt down signs
of life beneath the pancaked store
it took us hours said umut dingsahin turkish volunteer rescuer at the
scene during that time we were knocking and they were responding as we
advanced we began to hear murmurs
we are here to save you where are you the team shouted trying to reach
ariel aged just seven lamy and year old maria
then breakthrough seven responded ariel adding that she was stuck
next to dead man but as fate would have it covered with food
all three were surrounded by food so they could eat said fernandez so
unlike normal in this type of situation we have great possibility of saving
people on the sixth seventh or eighth day after the disaster
by early sunday the mood at the caribbean market had transformed from one of
somber determination to laughter and joy filled relief
it was electric when we saw the fruit of our labor when that little girl came
out said fernandez who had also found two other girls trapped in school
there was silence everyone was happy said turkish architect zeynep gul
uma
the three survivors were exhausted but lucid able to answer some questions
ariel mother ran to embrace her daughter and fernandez was able to deliver
the good news to maria son in florida
hi you should know your mother is alive he said by telephone you should
know that she is okay she was in the rubble of the supermarket
oh my god came the response on the other end of the phone cannot believe
it thank you thank you
it was just one of the latest stories of hope to emerge from the rubble of port
au prince
at un six story headquarters where the walls have become sarcophagus for so
many dane jen kristensen also emerged from the debris on sunday
he came out without scratch said un spokesman
un firefighter neville fouche expressed his amazement at the rescue five days
after the earthquake how is it possible it is simply miracle he said
everything was very quiet this morning and we heard the sound of stone being
hit against wall says fouche from then rescue teams rushed to clear away
the rubble plunging camera into the revealed hand and the first sign of
life
do not worry we ll get you out of there rescuers said
others were less fortunate
late on sunday un secretary general ban ki moon was to fly back to new york
bearing the bodies of some of the un staffers killed when the un headquarters
collapsed in what has become the global body worst tragedy ever
elsewhere in this ravaged city rescue workers also faced disappointment
belgian and luxembourg teams have already been recalled believing they have
done all they could to help find survivors the foreign ministry in brussels
said
dutch rescue teams and their sniffer dogs could find no signs of life in the
rubble of the mont lazarre slum just outside the capital forcing residents to
abandon the search for survivors and torch the squalid ruins in the hope of
stopping disease
at the hotel montana rumors that survivor may still be alive were shattered
when the body of an american man was pulled out of the site
just week ago the hotel was an idyllic spot for cocktail at sunset sunday
fast approaching sunset meant only diminished hope that more survivors might be
found

qaeda wing denies six leaders killed in yemen site
hong kong jan afp
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap denied that six of its leaders were
killed in yemeni air strike last week according to statement published by
the site monitoring group on monday
none of the mujahedeen were killed in that unjust and insidious raid rather
some brothers were slightly wounded the qaeda group said in statement on
jihadist forums site reported
the yemeni government has said that aqap military boss qassem al rimi died in

defiant obama defends first white house year
washington jan afp
barack obama mounted an impassioned defense of his crisis haunted first year as
president on sunday but admitted to facing personal doubts over the painfully
slow pace of the change he has promised
but the us leader pleaded with americans not to lose faith in his ambitious
drive for reform in rare point by point rebuttal of criticisms that he has
fallen short of expectations and that his leadership is too cool and detached
obama said that after his inauguration on january some observers had
proclaimed new era of bipartisan politics and racial harmony but those
lofty hopes had dissolved in washington political tumult
as we meet here today one year later we know the promise of that moment has
not yet been fully fulfilled he said in speech in historic baptist church
in washington dc
but on the eve of us holiday honoring martin luther king jr obama used the
methodical change wrought by the civil rights icon as metaphor for his
presidency as his approval ratings dwindle in crucial political year
obama flashed with impatience as he rebuked critics who say his top priority
health care reform drive is pale imitation of the meaningful change he
promised arguing he was in daily battle for step by step progress
sometimes get little frustrated when folks just don want to see that
even if we don get everything we re getting something he said
during brutal first year in the white house obama has rarely recreated the
passion of his euphoric campaign but emerged as an calm disciplined and
sometimes reserved figure dealing with america severe problems
but on sunday he turned up the rhetorical heat in apparent answer to critics
who say he has lost his connection with average voters and reprising his year
in what was effectively an update of his inaugural address
you know folks ask me sometimes why look so calm obama told worshippers
have confession to make there are times when not so calm there are
times when progress seems too slow there are times when the words that are
spoken about me hurt there are times when the barbs sting
there are times when it feels like all these efforts are for naught he added
change is so painfully slow in coming and have to confront my own doubts
obama said
obama has seen the stratospheric approval ratings of year ago decline to the
perilous sub percent range and is getting low marks in polls on his economic
management with unemployment at percent
supporters argue obama inherited terrible economic and political legacy from
his predecessor george bush but republicans brand him job killing
president who made bad situation worse
the president urged worshippers and americans across the country to share the
faith that he said was the foundation of his inner calm at time when many
experts believe obama prospects will only recover when the economy does
together we shall overcome the challenges of the new age together we shall
seize the promise of this moment together we shall make way through the
winter and we re going to welcome the spring
later the president swapped lofty rhetoric for the bare knuckle barbs of
campaigning as he stumped for democrat martha coakley who is stunningly at
risk of losing the senate seat once held by democratic lion edward kennedy
obama knows his political project could be badly damaged by coakley loss
victory for republican scott brown would rob democrats of the their vote
supermajority in the senate which is needed to overcome the opposition party
obstruction tactics and pass health care and other reforms
obama admitted america faced tough times and acknowledged that people are
frustrated and they re angry and they have every right to be
but he attacked those including brown who he said are eager to exploit
that pain and anger
there are always folks who think that the best way to solve these problems are
to demonize others and unfortunately we are seeing some of that politics in
massachusetts today
obama flying visit to boston was designed to drum up turnout for coakley who
polls show just behind or deadlocked with brown among the democratic voters who
gave the president landslide in the state in
ukrainian businessman flexes muscle in vote
kiev jan afp
tough guy businessman heading for third place has emerged as the surprise new
face in ukraine presidential elections and his supporters will be key in
deciding the run off vote
sergiy tigipko whose campaign enjoyed big late surge in popularity has
benefited from voters dissatisfaction with more established figures and is on
course to record some percent of the vote exit polls showed
while this is not enough to oust established rivals viktor yanukovich and yulia
tymoshenko from the run off it means his supporters will be assiduously wooed
by both sides ahead of the february second round
it also provides him with platform for campaign in the parliamentary
elections that are likely to follow and future presidential polls
buoyed by his poll success tigipko declined to endorse either candidate sunday
saying it was up to his supporters to decide
give no support for any one of them tell my voters to decide by
themselves he said
the people who supported me were voting for changes in ukraine for
modernization hear about this modernization neither from yanukovich nor from
tymoshenko
starting his political career as soviet era komsomol leader tigipko worked
after independence in the cabinet of former president leonid kuchma headed the
national bank of ukraine and built business empire
tigipko managed the presidential election campaign of yanukovich in but
deserted him when the mass protests of the orange revolution began alleging mass
vote rigging in his favour
the vote was re run and yanukovich defeated by pro western forces tigipko
disappeared from politics to concentrate on building up his business empire
for several years tigipko declared himself as totally apolitical but in
tigipko came back to politics this time in the camp of yulia tymoshenko as her
adviser but he then decided to stand on his own
by far the richest among candidates for presidency according to the official
declarations the year old tigipko targeted mainly the city electorate often
appearing in glossy magazines together with his glamorous wife and children
his sports filled spare time is taken up with athletics swimming football and
tennis
tigipko had initially been dismissed possible spoiling candidate working
secretly on behalf of either of the frontrunners
ukraine needs strong president declared athletic looking tigipko who
appears in his tv advertisements like movie thriller star with plane flying
above his head
tigipko advocates warmer relations with russia support of small and middle
business by tax cuts and reforming of the public health sector
but his greatest asset is that he had been absent from the political scene over
the last half decade when ukraine political elite has been discredited by
endless infighting and dire economic crisis
volodymyr fesenko director of the penta centre for political studies in kiev
said tigipko was not an entirely new face as he had held high office going back
to the presidency of leonid kuchma
but his success can be explained by the fact that he has not been present in
ukrainian politics over the last five years and many see him as very fresh
face he said

convincing to say the least favre said
the way we played today we will have to play that way again to win it
nfl all time passing leader favre who guided green bay to super bowl
crown before retiring made comeback last season with the jets but missed the
playoffs and retired again only to make return this season with minnesota
it has been wonderful favre said just to be in this position after all the
stuff that took place it wonderful moment it everything wanted it to
be and we re not done yet
favre had never beaten the cowboys in the playoffs or thrown four playoff
touchdowns in game but he did both in inflicting the second worst defeat in
cowboys history
this moment is really special regardless of age favre said it has been
lot of fun

indianapolis where the jets won three weeks ago to hand the colts their
first defeat after start
it the matchup nobody wanted but too bad here we come jets coach rex ryan
said here we are we don have to apologize to anybody it just throw it
down football and play great defense and here we are
indianapolis took criticism for worrying more about injuries than perfect
season and benching several starters including star peyton manning late in the
game because first round playoff bye and home field edge was assured
don know if santa claus is going to be that good to me again but would
be glad to see peyton manning not play this week ryan said

jay feely yard field goal and took the lead for good on mark sanchez two
yard touchdown pass to dustin keller with to play
we looked ugly there for while jets coach rex ryan said we took their
best shot we were hanging in there the fourth quarter is like the championship
rounds we re fortunate to come out on top

history to give new york lead rivers pulled the chargers within
with remaining on one yard run but the jets got the ball and ran out the
clock
sanchez an nfl rookie was spectator in san diego watching the playoffs
year ago but put the jets on the brink of their first super bowl since
win over the colts
we don think about it like that sanchez said we just take in the moment
and prepare like crazy once we get on the field we let our preparation set us
free

uncertain future for us climate law after copenhagen
washington jan afp
the future of us climate law is hanging in the balance in congress as
lawmakers gear up for crucial midterm elections amid persistent economic
slump experts say
further reducing the impetus un climate talks in copenhagen ended last month
with non binding agreement to limit warming to degrees fahrenheit two
celsius that did not set binding targets to reduce the emissions of gases
scientists say are heating up the world atmosphere to dangerous levels
among the thorniest problems facing possible us law is striking an agreement
on creating cap and trade market for greenhouse gases that would force heavy
polluters to buy credits from companies that pollute less creating financial
incentives to fight global warming
most democrats who enjoy majority in both houses of congress and
environmental groups see the proposed system as cornerstone of the fight
against the heat trapping gases hoping to reach an international agreement by
the end of the year to legally bind other countries to also reduce emissions
in copenhagen president barack obama acknowledged it is going to be very hard
and it going to take some time to reach such an accord
finger pointing and sharp recriminations followed the united nations summit
final agreement which has been widely panned for failing to oblige countries to
carry out concrete greenhouse gas emissions cuts
todd stern the us climate envoy told investors in new york thursday it was
tremendously important for the senate to act on some form of climate
legislation
the us house of representatives has already passed legislation on renewable
energy and curbing greenhouse gases but the senate has yet to take up its own
version of the bill
at the un climate talks obama proposed to reduce us emission by percent by
off levels an offer that hinges on congressional approval
it very difficult environment in the us right now said michael levi of
the council on foreign relations
he pointed to tense political and economic climate complicated even more by
percent unemployment and raging debate over bill to overhaul the beleaguered
us health care system obama top domestic priority
around half of the energy supply in the united states the world second
