controversy made the difference as city claimed win over united in the
rivals league cup semi final first leg here on tuesday
ryan giggs first derby goal since handed united the lead but tevez whose
decision to reject united and sign for their wealthy neighbours in the close
season was accompanied by such ill feeling scored twice taking his tally to
goals from his last games
tevez was always destined to play pivotal role in this semi final one way or
another
sure enough when craig bellamy was held back by badly beaten united full back
rafael five minutes before the interval it was the argentinian forward who was
handed the responsibility of converting from the penalty spot one he gleefully
accepted with an emphatic finish
tevez gesture to former team mate gary neville sat in his customary position
on the united bench told the defender to be silent and was sweet revenge for
the city man having endured half of baiting and abuse from visiting
supporters
the penalty cancelled out giggs early opening goal which came from united
first attack of note
patrice evra found antonio valencia on the right wing bellamy appeared to have
stifled the danger with challenge on the winger but valencia slipped past the
city man and took advantage of vincent kompany failure to cut out the cross
near post touch from wayne rooney took the ball away from city keeper shay
given and giggs was well placed to convert into an open net from practically on
the goalline
the second half winner was vintage tevez although it was again the result of
poor defending from united something that has happened with alarming regularity
for sir alex ferguson team this season
bellamy th minute cross from the left wing caused panic in the visiting
defence following weak punched clearance from edwin van der sar
pablo zabaleta did good job of keeping the ball live chipping back into the
area for kompany to cross and find tevez who headed in from close range
the overwrought pre match build up from city was perhaps understandable
since they last appeared in major semi final of the fa cup total of
different league clubs have reached the last four of one or other of the two
major domestic knockout competitions
united seemed in the mood to ruin city planned party but city response to
falling behind was spirited with shaun wright phillips steaming to the right
hand by line delivering perfect cross with which tevez failed to connect from
six yards
united started the second half the brighter looking to regain control of the
tie but their failure to deal with city corners was increasingly apparent
starting in the th minute when evra had to make timely block to stop micah
richards shooting in following bellamy flag kick
united responded with rooney crossing for giggs whose header drew an amazing
save from shay given falling backwards and almost in his own net and the
england forward then sending dipping shot rising over the bar from distance
but after conceding the second things might have got worse for united with
van der sar being forced into solid diving save to keep out wright phillips
blast following neat pass into the area from bellamy
united would dominate the closing proceedings however and rooney one two
with substitute michael owen in the th minute played him clean in on goal
where given made fantastic block owen then steering the loose ball goalwards
where nedum onuoha made simple clearance
two minutes later rooney was again city tormentor with twisting run into
the area and an audacious shot which given tipped over united pressed until the
end with valencia missing far post volley from an evra cross and given saving
well once again to deny rooney

recovery phase and obviously we continue to be in prayer said major general

several diseases form deadly brain cancer study
washington jan afp
the most common form of malignant brain cancer in adults is actually set of
four different pathologies according to study published tuesday that could
lead to more targeted treatment
in identifying the separate subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme gbm brain
tumors the us research team found that each one may form in different types of
cells and thus require separate therapies
most patients who develop gbm which spreads rapidly to other parts of the brain
and is challenging to treat die within about months after they are
diagnosed
three of every americans have been diagnosed with the disease in recent
years the highest incidence rate for malignant brain tumors among its most
famous victims was the late senator ted kennedy who died in august
we discovered bundle of events that unequivocally occur almost exclusively
within subtype lead author neil hayes of the university of north carolina at
chapel hill said in statement
these are critical events in the history of the tumor development and spread
and evidence is increasing that they may relate to the initial formation of the
tumors
this finding could help understand which types of cells undergo changes that are
ultimately responsible for initial cancer formation key to crafting targeted
and effective treatment regimens
each subtype reacted differently to aggressive chemotherapy and radiation the
researchers found which would mean that certain classes of drugs would work for
some subtypes of brain tumors and not others
patients with one gbm subtype treated with aggressive chemotherapy and radiation
seemed to be affected at rate about percent slower than those treated with
less aggressive therapy
this effect appeared less prominently in two of the subtypes and not at all in
the fourth subtype
for their study published in the journal cancer cell the researchers analyzed
patient samples as part of the cancer genome atlas research network
government funded project launched in to map all dna activity in different
types of cancers
these findings demonstrate the power of using cancer genome to unravel the
molecular changes that occur in the various cancer types targeted by tcga said
eric green director of the national human genome research institute which is
part of the national institutes of health
optimistic that this type of knowledge will someday lead to improved
personalized therapies and care for cancer patients

charged in us foreign bribery scheme
washington jan afp
twenty two people in the military and police products industry were arrested and
charged in sweeping probe into violations of the foreign corrupt practices
act the department of justice said tuesday
the detainees arrested monday in las vegas nevada the other in miami
are charged with trying to obtain foreign contracts chiefly in africa by
bribing government officials
they were arrested in an undercover operation lasting two and half years
assistant attorney general lanny breuer said in department of justice
statement
this ongoing investigation is the first large scale use of undercover law
enforcement techniques to uncover fcpa violations he added
most of the suspects worked for us military equipment manufacturers two worked
for british firms and one for an israeli company the department of justice
said without naming the businesses due to the ongoing nature of the
investigation
the executives agents and employees of the companies allegedly agreed to pay
percent commission to sales agent for the defense ministry of an unnamed
african nation to secure million dollar contract to equip its presidential
guard
in reality the sales agent was an undercover fbi federal bureau of
investigation agent breuer said
corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain or retain business erode public
confidence in our free market system and threaten to undermine foreign
governments said us attorney channing phillips
former justice department fraud chief steven tyrrell called the arrests
extremely significant both in numbers twice as many fpca cases were
brought in than in and in the nature of the investigations
these matters involve the use of traditional undercover investigative
techniques something we have not seen much of in the past in the fcpa
context said tyrrell

us military to use two more airports for haiti aid
washington jan afp
the us military is to start operations at two other airports as port au prince
damaged airport equipped with single strained runway struggles to deal with
over aid flights day
the pentagon told reporters tuesday it would begin using other runways inside
haiti and across the border in the dominican republic
the first runway in haiti proper will go into operation in the vicinity of
jacmel within the next hours said major general daniel allyn the deputy
commander of the us task force responding to last week massive earthquake
jacmel to the southwest of port au prince was badly hit by the magnitude
quake but has an airfield that allyn said had been assessed for use
we will begin to use that airfield primarily initially supporting the build
up of the canadian humanitarian assistance efforts that will be centered there
in jacmel allyn told reporters at the pentagon
he added the airport would also be used to continue to deliver food and
emergency supplies to the people in the southern provinces of haiti
the other airport that will be used is san isidro in the dominican republic
allyn said we are obviously very conscious of the need to have multiple ports
of entry
international military and aid personnel have struggled with haiti limited
airport capacity since the launch of massive relief effort last week
port au prince airport which is being run by the us military has single
airstrip and is being operated with damaged control tower
the country main seaport was also damaged in the disaster but allyn said the
military was close to initial operating capability in the port of port au
prince and was doing assessments of the other ports to rapidly support joint
logistics brought from afloat to shore
state department spokesman philip crowley said the issue remains the limited
infrastructure that is inhibiting us from bringing more and more food water
shelter into the country
but the assistance that is getting to the airport is flowing out to the
people of haiti he said
the challenge is that we are not yet at the level where we can sustain
population of three million people he said although he added that we re
making progress every day
he said the arrival of the marine amphibious group in the last hours allowed
the us to send helicopter flights into port au prince as well as vehicles like
humvees to different parts of the city and outlying areas
obama allies seek to save health care plan
washington jan afp
president barack obama top democratic allies vowed tuesday to achieve his top
domestic goal remaking us health care no matter the outcome of special
senate election that could doom the plan
republicans hoped to pull off stunning upset win in massachusetts and seize
the seat held nearly half century by the late democratic icon ted kennedy
breaking the democrats seat supermajority in the bargain
but democratic house speaker nancy pelosi promised that house and senate
negotiators would soon overcome the final obstacles to producing legislation
blending the two chambers rival bills to enact the historic overhaul
whatever happens in massachusetts we will have quality affordable health care
for all americans and it will be soon pelosi said we re right on course we
will have health care reform bill and it will be soon
pelosi played down talk that the house of representatives would simply take up
the senate bill in order to avoid fresh vote there without the votes needed
to ensure passage over united republicans delaying tactics
we have to resolve some differences establish some priorities make some
decisions and that what we re doing whatever happens in massachusetts we
have to do that she told reporters
many house members and democrats labor union allies whose help is especially
crucial heading into the november mid term elections have opposed the senate
bill and won key modifications over the past few weeks
but some aides speculated privately about the historic legislation fate if
little known republican state senator scott brown were to pull off stunning
upset of democrat martha coakley in race she had been expected to easily win
earlier democratic house majority leader steny hoyer said obama allies still
hoped to meld the senate and house plans but that the senate bill clearly is
better than nothing
victory by brown who has vowed to oppose the legislation would give
democrats little time to act before he is seated process senate and
massachusetts electoral officials suggest may take at least ten days
asked whether democrats could reach their elusive house senate deal craft
formal bill and hold the final senate and house votes all in the next two
weeks hoyer replied yes
the democratic plan aims to extend health care coverage to as many as million
of the million americans who lack it now and curb abusive insurance company
practices
democrats working on the final compromise had next to no margin for error the
senate passed its bill on christmas eve by exactly the votes needed and the
house got just two more than the needed seven weeks earlier
democrats have said they hope to pass compromise bill before obama marquee
annual state of the union address now set for january
the united states is the world richest nation but the only industrialized
democracy that does not provide health care coverage to all of its citizens
the united states spends more than double what britain france and germany do
per person on health care
but it lags behind other countries in life expectancy and infant mortality
