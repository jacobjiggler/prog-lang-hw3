season was accompanied by such ill feeling scored twice taking his tally to
goals from his last games
tevez was always destined to play pivotal role in this semi final one way or
another
sure enough when craig bellamy was held back by badly beaten united full back
fabio five minutes before the interval it was the argentinian forward who was
handed the responsibility of converting from the penalty spot one he gleefully
accepted with an emphatic finish
tevez gesture to former team mate gary neville sat in his customary position
on the united bench told the defender to be silent and was sweet revenge for
the city man having endured half of baiting and abuse from visiting
supporters
the penalty cancelled out giggs early opening goal which came from united
first attack of note
patrice evra found antonio valencia on the right wing bellamy appeared to have
stifled the danger with challenge on the winger but valencia slipped past the
city man and took advantage of vincent kompany failure to cut out the cross
near post touch from wayne rooney took the ball away from city keeper shay
given and giggs was well placed to convert into an open net from practically on
the goalline
the second half winner was vintage tevez although it was again the result of
poor defending from united something that has happened with alarming regularity
for sir alex ferguson team this season
bellamy th minute cross from the left wing caused panic in the visiting
defence following weak punched clearance from edwin van der sar
pablo zabaleta did good job of keeping the ball live chipping back into the
area for kompany to cross and find tevez who headed in from close range
the overwrought pre match build up from city was perhaps understandable
since they last appeared in major semi final of the fa cup total of
different league clubs have reached the last four of one or other of the two
major domestic knockout competitions
united seemed in the mood to ruin city planned party but city response to
falling behind was spirited with shaun wright phillips steaming to the right
hand by line delivering perfect cross with which tevez failed to connect from
six yards
united started the second half the brighter looking to regain control of the
tie but their failure to deal with city corners was increasingly apparent
starting in the th minute when evra had to make timely block to stop micah
richards shooting in following bellamy flag kick
united responded with rooney crossing for giggs whose header drew an amazing
save from shay given falling backwards and almost in his own net and the
england forward then sending dipping shot rising over the bar from distance
but after conceding the second things might have got worse for united with
van der sar being forced into solid diving save to keep out wright phillips
blast following neat pass into the area from bellamy
united would dominate the closing proceedings however and rooney one two
with substitute michael owen in the th minute played him clean in on goal
where given made fantastic block owen then steering the loose ball goalwards
where nedum onuoha made simple clearance
two minutes later rooney was again city tormentor with twisting run into
the area and an audacious shot which given tipped over united pressed until the
end with valencia missing far post volley from an evra cross and given saving
well once again to deny rooney

supreme court orders review of ex black panther reprieve
washington jan afp
the us supreme court on tuesday ordered lower court to reconsider its decision
to overturn the death sentence against ex black panther mumia abu jamal for the
murder of police officer
the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the united states court of
appeals the highest court in the united states said in its ruling
the decision is not bad said abu jamal lawyer robert bryan in statement
now we must go back to litigating the issue of the death penalty in the lower
federal court he said
abu jamal death sentence was overturned in march by three member
pennsylvania court in two to one vote
the court upheld the former black panther conviction for the murder of white
philadelphia police officer daniel faulkner but ruled that the jury in abu
jamal trial had been given faulty instructions by the judge during
sentencing
the jury was mistakenly led to believe that it could not consider mitigating
factors against sentencing abu jamal to death unless all the jury members agreed
on the particular factor
pennsylvania appealed that ruling citing another death penalty case in which it
said similar instructions were given but the sentence was still upheld
that case involved frank spisak who was convicted of three murders in ohio and
attended his trial wearing carefully cultivated hitler style moustache and
proudly expressed desire to kill blacks jews and homosexuals
abu jamal lawyer bryan said tuesday supreme court decision was
unavoidable in view of the spisak case ruling
but he disputed the similarities between the two cases
what occurred in mumia case is different both procedurally and factually from
the jury instructions in spisak he said
the ruling is second supreme court setback for abu jamal in as many years
last year the supreme court refused to take up an appeal he filed challenging
his conviction and requesting new trial
abu jamal has claimed innocence during his years on death row and he
and his supporters have said his trial was fundamentally unfair and racist
his supporters claim the verdict against him was predetermined because he was an
african american and founding member of the radical leftist black panthers
movement accused of killing white police officer
ten of the prosecution challenges against potential jurors in the trial
were used to strike blacks from the jury which was ultimately composed of
white members and two black members
and the judge overseeing his trial was even reported to have declared
going to help them fry the nigger
further tarnishing the conviction in man named arnold beverly swore an
affidavit saying he was hired by local mafia organization to kill faulkner in
because the policeman was investigating organized crime in philadelphia
the doubt thrown on his trial as well as his outspoken commentary and striking
long dreadlocks have made abu jamal an icon for campaigners against the death
penalty
he has attracted the support of numerous celebrities and high profile activists
and in france he was declared an honorary citizen by paris and had street
named for him in paris suburb
more than haiti orphans flown to the us
washington jan afp
more than haitian orphans landed in the united states on tuesday and were
immediately taken for medical check ups hospital officials said
their orphanage in port au prince was run by two us sisters from pennsylvania
ali and jaime mcmutrie who campaigned for days to get the group of some
desperate children out of the devastated caribbean nation

suffering from dehydration and diarrhea lukasiak said adding that it was too
early to know their overall condition
the children most of whom were awaiting adoption by american families in
process that normally takes months arrived on military transport plane
accompanied by pennsylvania governor ed rendell local television reported
some us families hoping to adopt the children welcomed the orphans at the
airport the tv station wpxi reported
the mcmutries had waged days long campaign that included barrage of messages
on the social networking website facebook and endless tweets on twitter to
persuade the pittsburgh authorities to come for the children
us authorities gave the green light on monday to allow haitian orphans to enter
the country legally so they could receive the care they needed in the wake of
last tuesday magnitude quake
they also relaxed the adoption rules so that us parents adopting children from
haiti would not have to wait for final paperwork or passports from the haitian
government
rendell told cnn that the evacuation was nearly cancelled at the last minute
when he was told that only of the children those whose adoptions had already
been approved could be flown out of haiti
ali and jamie mcmutrie said unless everybody goes all kids nobody
going rendell said
eventually approval came through for all the children to leave but they were
forced to hitch ride aboard military plane when their waiting aircraft was
took off without them to clear room at port au prince small airport
the group finally boarded their plane and took off much to the excitement of
the children who had never been onboard flight before only to discover one
little girl had been left behind rendell said
but two year old emma who had fallen asleep on bus going to the airport was
eventually located in haiti and was put on another plane coming to the united
states he added

new york jan afp
the dollar climbed to its highest level against the euro in nearly month
tuesday boosted by concerns about weak investor confidence in germany and
greece debt crisis
the european single currency fell to dollars at gmt from
dollars late on monday
earlier the euro sank to dollars its lowest level since december
against the japanese currency the dollar strengthened to yen from
yen on monday
the us foreign exchange market rejoined global trading after being closed monday
for the us martin luther king holiday
the dollar is benefiting from others misfortunes today especially as the euro
is finding itself under some notable selling pressure said vassili serebriakov
of wells fargo bank
larger than expected drop in germany investor confidence is adding to the
ongoing negative sentiment surrounding the greek budget situation he said
the analyst noted that other major currencies were trending lower but the
british pound was holding up better than most thanks to stronger inflation
data
in germany investor sentiment fell for fourth month running in january as
europe biggest economy braced for burdensome and long recovery the zew
economic research institute said
the zew indicator of german economic sentiment fell more steeply than forecast
to an indexed points its lowest level since july
germany january zew survey provided more negative news for the euro said
jane foley analyst at online trading firm forex com
greece continues to contribute most of the negative pressure on the euro she
added
international rating agency moody on tuesday said it was maintaining
negative outlook on greece because it was unclear whether the government could
implement plan to shore up public finances
given the lack of certainty surrounding the greek government ability to
implement the program moody negative outlook remains unchanged the agency
said
the greek government which last month suffered credit downgrade from all
three leading ratings agencies is struggling to overcome huge debt and public
deficit that have sparked concern among its eurozone partners
the british pound rallied after official data tuesday revealed larger than
expected percent annualized spike in inflation in recession hit britain in

increase in core inflation which breaches the bank of england percent
target for the first time since last march and potentially complicates their
quantitative easing program

dollars especially payments made to aig trading partners
