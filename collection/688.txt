yachting oracle rejects alinghi rules for america cup
madrid jan afp
america cup challenger oracle on tuesday rejected the rules for the rd
edition of the race proposed by alinghi arguing they are heavily biased in
favour the swiss defender and said they would ask jury to revise the rules
before the match
in statement oracle said both the notice of race and the sailing
instructions submitted by the swiss team are riddled with errors and they
continue the practice of interpreting rules or creating new ones solely
to favour alinghi and harm the chances of the challenger
the dispute over the rules further diminishes the chances that the multihull
duel between the two sides will begin off the coast of valencia in eastern spain
on february after alinghi on monday turned down an offer by oralce to settle
dispute over the swiss team sails
under the america cup rules challenger proposes to race the defending
champion and together they plan the terms of the next race
but oracle said the societie nautique de geneve sng which represents alinghi
ignored its input as well as feedback provided by isaf the sport wolrd
governing body during meetings held last week in singapore and last month in
sydney
it is clearer than ever that sng is hell bent on making the america cup the
alinghi cup we now look to the international jury to reinstate the correct and
proper rules and procedures it said in the statement
oracle said alinghi has set wind and wave limits which favour its own yacht set
the starting time for races even though this should be decided by both sides by
mutual consent and banned wind detection equipment currently being used by the
us side which had been previously allowed
the two sides have been arguing over the rules of the america cup in court
since the swiss syndicate won the last edition in valencia in
the new york court ruled in april that the cup should be settled by one on one
multihull duel between the two sides next february instead of the traditional
fully fledged regatta involving several teams
earlier tuesday the giant trimaran oracle took to the water off spain for the
first time
the us yacht with its metre fixed wing sail sailed in the bay off the
mediterranean port of valencia with australia james spithill at the helm
everyone was very excited to get out on the water oracle team ceo russell
coutts said after the boat was sailed at the sight of the rd america cup for
the first time
coutts said the boat which had been called the bor was now named the usa
it was sporting the name usa emblazoned on its stern when it hit the water
spain to curb pay of air traffic controllers
madrid jan afp
the government plans to curb the salaries of spain air traffic
controllers to make the nation loss making airports more competitive public
works minister jose blanco said tuesday
the move comes after an audit of state run airport management company aena found
that some controllers earned nearly times more than prime minister jose luis
rodriguez zapatero causing outrage in the recession hit country
blanco said the government would slash the pay of the controllers to an average
of around euros us dollars per year from an average of
euros this would make it possible to cut aviation taxes
the numbers speak for themselves this is not efficient he told reporters
the audit found that controllers earned between euros and
euros year earned between and euros and were paid
between and euros
by comparison zapatero earns just under euros year while the average
salary in spain is just over euros per year according to government
figures
centre right daily newspaper el mundo called the salaries earned by the
controllers scandalous
despite their high pay the controllers staged work to rule protest at the end
of which caused flight delays during the busy christmas period
aena which manages spain state run airports posted lost of
million euros last year
cruise ships dock at haiti resort despite quake
miami jan afp
luxury cruise ships will continue to dock as normal at an idyllic resort in
northern haiti despite the deadly earthquake week ago that devastated the
caribbean nation company said tuesday
royal caribbean international which has donated one million dollars to the
haiti relief effort and is bringing in emergency supplies on its huge ships
defended the move by saying it was important to keep the haitian economy ticking
over despite the tragedy
the giant liberty of the seas which has capacity for passengers was to
drop anchor later tuesday off the port of labadee where the company leases
private resort with beautiful beaches and sparkling turquoise waters
we are on regular itinerary with three ships going to labadee per week the
company director of communications lyan sierra caro told afp
navigator of the seas yesterday monday today liberty of the seas will be
there and celebrity solstice on friday we have no reports on cancellations so
far
but not everyone thought it appropriate for tourists to be lapping up luxury on
haitian beaches while rescuers are struggling to find survivors and bring relief
to those living in wretched conditions following tuesday catastrophe
can imagine having to choke down burger there now knowing how many have
died and how many are dying of thirst and who will probably die of their
injuries said blogger bakincakes visitor to the resort some years ago
labadee where royal caribbean employs hundreds of haitians is on haiti
northern coast which was largely unaffected by the magnitude earthquake
officials fear the quake may have killed up to people in and around the
capital port au prince million remain homeless hungry and shell shocked in
the aftermath of the tragedy
adam goldstein chief executive of royal caribbean international wrote on his
blog that continuing to send cruise ships was exactly the right thing to do
despite the huge suffering further south
being on the island and generating economic activity for the straw market
vendors the hair braiders and our employees helps with relief while being
somewhere else does not help he wrote
and he told fox business network that when the captain of the independence of
the seas the first ship to go back to haiti informed the guests that we were
going to go to haiti he got standing ovation
the overwhelming majority of the guests are comfortable with what is going on
pleased with the relief efforts and happy to contribute through their
activities on the land there
goldstein said his ships were each taking between and pallets of vital
supplies to the island and we re looking into how we can bring even more
supplies in per call
royal caribbean vice president john weis said thursday that the supplies
included rice dried beans and water
this effort is going to be marathon so we will be partnering with food for
the poor on the back end distribution in haiti
the oasis of the seas the largest cruise ship in the world which has rooms for
passengers and is also operated by royal caribbean made its first stop at
labadee on december
us designates al qaeda in arabian peninsula terrorist group
washington jan afp
the united states named tuesday al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap
terrorist group in bid to cut support to the outfit blamed for the plot to
bring down detroit bound jet on christmas day
the state department said it has also asked un committee that looks at
sanctions against al qaeda and the taliban to take similar actions against aqap
and its leaders nasir al wahishi and said al shihri
these actions prohibit provision of material support and arms to aqap and also
include immigration related restrictions that will help stem the flow of
finances to aqap department spokesman philip crowley said in statement
the designations made by secretary of state hillary clinton in consultation
with other senior us officials also give the department of justice the tools
it needs to prosecute aqap members he added
crowley said the yemen based group has claimed it was behind number of attacks
against saudi korean yemeni and us targets since it was founded in january
these include march suicide bombing against south korean tourists in yemen an
attempt in august to assassinate saudi prince muhammad bin nayif and the
december bid to blow up flight from amsterdam as it landed in detroit
the designations represent just one phase of the us government response to
the aqap threat crowley said
he said washington has also asked officials at un committee set up by
security council resolution in to pursue sanctions against al qaeda
and the taliban to take similar actions against the group and its leaders
if successful this will require all un member states to implement an asset
freeze travel ban and arms embargo against these entities crowley said
these designations will occur less than one month after the security council
adopted resolution which renewed and strengthened the regime he
said
he said the resolution created major new improvements to the way the un
imposes sanctions on al qaeda and the taliban
the actions taken today against aqap support the us effort to degrade the
capabilities of this group he said
we are determined to eliminate aqap ability to execute violent attacks and to
disrupt dismantle and defeat their networks crowley added

battling low level islamist insurgency from more stable parts

of krasnoyarsk as his new envoy to north caucasus federal district post that
also comes with the rank of deputy prime minister
document was signed by me today appointing you as the presidential envoy
to the north caucasus federal district medvedev told khloponin in
comments broadcast on state television
the new federal district includes chechnya dagestan ingushetia where
insurgency violence has picked up in recent months as well as the neighbouring
territories of kabardino balkaria karachayevo cherkessia north ossetia and the
stavropol region
these mountainous areas were formerly part of wider area called the southern
administrative district which will remain in reduced form while the new
district will become russia eighth federal unit
khloponin former businessman and trained economist has no previous ties to
the region
he served on the board of directors of metals giant norilsk nickel from to
was elected governor of krasnoyarsk region in and is member of the
ruling united russia party
medvedev acknowledged the envoy faced very difficult task but said he hoped
the appointment would boost economic development in the north caucasus as part
of the kremlin efforts to stabilise the troubled region
so far our economic projects are proving very difficult there is mass
unemployment economic crimes and bribe taking he said
experts welcomed khloponin appointment saying it signaled shift towards
greater focus on fighting poverty and corruption

economically and socially developed region he is man who knows how to develop
region said grigory shvedov editor in chief of the caucasian knot internet

alexander cherkasov an activist with rights group memorial hailed khloponin as
someone with different logic than the silovikis referring to clan of
russian politicians with security and military backgrounds
khloponin will take over from the current envoy to the southern district
vladimir ustinov former prosecutor general who oversaw the probe that led to
the imprisonment of former yukos oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky and is highly
unpopular among rights activists
but analysts also queried whether the new appointment would be successful in
transferring power from local north caucasus leaders like chechen strongman
ramzan kadyrov back to the kremlin
the key questions is khloponin mandate will he have more powers than the
president other envoys to the caucasus shvedov said he needs this to be
able to resolve the region problems promptly
