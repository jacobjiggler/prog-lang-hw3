trial starts for pakistani scientist in afghan shooting mystery
new york jan afp
pakistani neuroscientist accused of trying to kill us soldiers and fbi agents
during mysterious incident at an afghan police station went on trial tuesday
in new york
prosecutors painted aafia siddiqui as would be terrorist who in
grabbed us soldier rifle at the afghan police station where she was being
interrogated and tried to slaughter group of servicemen
the defendant picked up that assault rifle saw agents and soldiers and tried
to kill them assistant us attorney jenna dabbs said
but lawyers for the us educated siddiqui who repeatedly interrupted the
federal court to denounce the proceedings said there is no hard evidence that
she fired shot
defense attorney charles swift pointed to inconsistencies in witnesses
testimony and told jurors you re not going to have any physical evidence that
it the rifle was fired
journalists and supporters of siddiqui many of them wearing the hijab and other
muslim garb crammed the courtroom and an overflow room where the trial was
relayed by television link
the prosecution of siddiqui is the most advanced in string of current cases
related to what washington calls the war on terror
several other suspects in alleged bomb plots are working their way through the
system and the self described mastermind of the september attacks is
also due to be tried in new york
some have criticized such trials saying that an impartial jury would be
impossible to assemble in new york reflecting that concern prospective jurors
in siddiqui trial were asked before being selected whether their opinions were
colored by experiences related to the attacks
another criticism has been that defendants will use their trials as platforms to
make verbal attacks
siddiqui has repeatedly disrupted the court in pre trial hearings jury
selection and did so again on the first day of her trial
told by the judge she had right to leave the courtroom and listen from an
adjacent cell via tv monitor she replied being forced right means
don have to take it you re forcing me to take it
she also said of her defense team don recognize them as my lawyers
this is not fair court this is something else
prosecutors say siddiqui was arrested by afghan police july in the
provincial city of ghazni with notes on her referring to mass casualty
attack and target lists including new york landmarks such as the empire state
building
the next day while being held in the second floor of the local police building
she allegedly grabbed an assault rifle belonging to one of several us
servicemen and fbi agents who had come to interrogate her
she opened fire missed and was shot by one of the us soldiers using handgun
prosecutors allege
defense lawyers say all that is sure is that she was shot she was brought to
the united states shortly after the incident nursing fresh bullet wound to her
abdomen

football portsmouth upbeat after court tax challenge fails
london jan afp
english premier league crisis club portsmouth insisted they could stave off the
threat of winding up petition from british tax authorities on appeal after
court hearing went against them on tuesday
cash strapped portsmouth had argued the value added tax portion of its huge tax
bill was too high by as much as million pounds million dollars
but judge guy newey found against portsmouth at london high court and ruled
tax collectors her majesty revenue and customs hmrc could proceed with their
legal action to wind up the club
however newey said portsmouth could appeal and statement issued by the club
said we would like to once again thank supporters for their continued support
and patience
the owner the board and associates would like to assure fans that they are
working hard towards positive solution and are confident that this matter will
be resolved in our favour
earlier court spokesman said at the high court today tuesday mr justice
newey dismissed an application from portsmouth football club limited for
winding up petition to be struck out
further hearing to consider hmrc winding up petition will take place in due
course
that hearing is now expected on february and the outcome could send bottom
of the table pompey step closer to becoming the first premier league club to
enter administration move that would likely see them docked league points
they cannot afford to lose
portsmouth have been facing off field problems since before the start of the
season with the protracted sale of the club from alexandre gaydamak to sulaiman
al fahim hampering the south coast side ability to bring in new players
al fahim was only in charge for matter of weeks before selling on to saudi
businessman ali al faraj who has struggled to cope with the club debts and
has acquired the nickname al mirage for his absence from the ground on match
days
pompey have three times this season failed to pay their players on time and last
week saw the premier league divert seven million pounds in television revenues
to other clubs owed transfer fees by the south coast side
so concerned are the premier league they have placed portsmouth who as recently
as won the fa cup under transfer embargo
but the club bit back on monday by threatening league chiefs with arbitration
proceedings saying they had agreed payment scheduled with other clubs
portsmouth executive director mark jacob said on monday the total amount that
we directed the premier league to discharge and pay these clubs is approximately
five million pounds
so there is net balance due to the club approaching two million pounds we
cannot see how they can keep the money and also continue with the embargo
former pompey manager harry redknapp now at tottenham hotspur former chairman
milan mandaric now at leicester and current portsmouth chief executive peter
storrie all face individual charges of tax evasion resulting from their time at
fratton park
portsmouth four points adrift at the foot of the table are at home to top
