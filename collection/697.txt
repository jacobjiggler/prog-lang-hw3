danish pm condemns self censorship in halted westergaard sale
copenhagen jan afp
danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen on tuesday criticised an auction
house for refusing to sell drawing by kurt westergaard the cartoonist behind
the most controversial mohammed caricature
speaking to reporters rasmussen warned of the dangers of self censorship and
stigmatisation of which we are seeing the first signs
if we start isolating or turning our back on those who need our protection and
support the most we are giving up he said
online auction house lauritz com on monday refused to include in charity sale
to benefit victims of the haiti earthquake westergaard watercolour citing
security fears for its employees among other concerns
we have in the past refused objects if they had debate provoking religious or
political connotation the head of lauritz com mette rode sundstroem told tv
news
westergaard told afp he was very pleased by the prime minister support
because self censorship destroys freedom of expression to which we are very
attached in denmark
the cartoonist said he found it difficult to grasp how non political non
religious watercolour could be censored especially since the sale was for
good cause
the small galleri draupnher in the town of skanderborg has put the watercolour
on sale from tuesday to saturday
westergaard is one of cartoonists whose drawings on islam were first
published in danish newspaper jyllands posten in september his cartoon
depicted mohammed wearing turban in the shape of bomb
the cartoons were considered offensive by many muslims and their publication
sparked violent protests worldwide in january and february as well as
string of death threats

westergaard in his house the cartoonist has been under round the clock police
protection since then

us to shift soon to recovering bodies in haiti military
washington jan afp
the united states expects to transition very soon from searching for survivors
of haiti killer earthquake to recovering bodies top us military commander
said tuesday
hopes were dimming to find survivors still buried under the rubble nearly week
after the devastating temblor that leveled port au prince and surrounding areas
leaving up to people dead
we fully expect that we will transition very soon from the search phase to the
recovery phase and obviously we continue to be in prayer major general daniel
allyn deputy commander of the us military operation in haiti told reporters
but at week after the initiation of the earthquake we have not found any
us survivors in the last two days so we are doubtful that we will be
fortunate but obviously we remain in prayer and hopeful
his comments came just hours after the united nations said survivors could still
be found under the debris
international search and rescue teams have extracted more than survivors from
beneath collapsed buildings since the disaster struck on january un office
for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha elisabeth byrs told afp
some us marines anchored off haiti coast in four naval vessels on
monday bringing the total us military contingent to including
aboard vessels offshore he said
total us troop strength of over was expected to operate in the
impoverished caribbean nation within the coming weeks with around half of
them involved in delivering humanitarian assistance ashore allyn said
around marines began moving ashore early tuesday for beach landing to
support relief efforts west of port au prince
survivors were still scrambling for desperately need food and water supplies
after massive logjam at the capital us controlled airport which has only
one runway and whose control tower was destroyed allyn said some flights
were now taking place per day
the us military has delivered over bottles of water and food
rations so far and some gallons liters of water per day was
being produced aboard us naval ships allyn said adding that he expected to
approach self sustaining water production capacity within days
dozen water purification units were also set to arrive in haiti within days
on monday aircraft flew from pope air force base in north carolina to
drop large pallet filled with supplies in northeast port au prince delivering
nearly meals and over liters gallons of water
but another air drop of this size was not expected until wednesday said colonel
david lapan pentagon spokesman
the fact is that it takes forces on the ground to secure the areas where these
drops must go in and to organize the people to avoid chaotic distribution when
those supplies come in allyn said
and we needed to wait until we had adequate forces to enable that to happen
and with that capacity building every day we will continue to use this and
every other means available to us to increase the reach of our efforts to the
people of haiti
another pounds kilograms of food and water were also delivered by
air to the coastal city of jacmel
amid growing unrest and sporadic looting among destitute haitians allyn said
we are watching for signs of instability but he stressed that the united
nations stabilization mission minustah and haitian police not us troops were
tasked with maintaining security

ex bosnian commander appeals conviction
the hague jan afp
former bosnian army commander rasim delic on tuesday appealed his conviction for
cruel treatment in the un yugoslav war crimes court saying he was not
responsible for the actions of subordinates
delic lawyer john jones told the international criminal tribunal for the
former yugoslavia there was at least reasonable doubt that delic exerted
effective control over fighters who maltreated serb detainees in
the tribunal sentenced delic to three year jail term in september
finding him criminally liable for cruel treatment but acquitting him of murder
the court found that delic had reason to have known of the cruelty meted out by
his troops but failed to prevent or punish the perpetrators
the crimes were committed by muslim extremist fighters called the mujahedin or
holy warriors who formed unit the el mujahed detachment or emd of the
bosnian army who were mainly made up of foreign volunteers
the serb detainees were severely beaten and given electric shocks one of the
group was killed his head severed and placed on his stomach after which the
others were forced to kiss the head according to the court findings
delic was tried on the basis of superior criminal responsibility for
failing to prevent or punish the crimes
he was one of the most senior figures in the bosnian military hierarchy to be
charged with abuses during the country war with serbia
delic who pleaded not guilty after surrendering to the tribunal in february
on tuesday again asked the court to acquit him
but the prosecution which also appealed the judgment argued that the
sentence did not reflect the gravity of the crimes delic was convicted of and
asked for it to be increased to seven years
no date has been set for the appeal ruling
kennedy seat loss would imperil obama health drive
boston massachusetts jan afp
republicans hoped for huge upset in us senate election in massachusetts
tuesday which could scupper president barack obama health reform drive and
cloud his entire agenda
voters headed to the polls undaunted by crisp winter weather and some light snow
in special election called following the death of party icon and health care
champion edward kennedy who died from cancer last august
should democrats lose the seat their vote senate supermajority will
dissolve allowing republicans to throw up multiple road blocks to slow obama
sweeping domestic agenda
lackluster campaign by democratic nominee martha coakley and fiery
insurgent bid by republican scott brown fanning populist anger at obama
program and the economic crisis set up the possibility of stunning upset
the choice could not be more stark and the result could not be of greater
consequence for massachusetts or the nation obama said in an email to
voters
early signs pointed to brisk turnout in the liberal northeastern state with
democrats hoping to confound late polls showing brown with an unlikely advantage
by firing up massive voter turnout operation
both parties spent millions of advertising dollars when it became clear late
last week that the race was unexpectedly close and top democrats and party
workers from outside massachusetts have been flooding voters with calls
for obama the stakes could not be higher he had appeared to be on the verge of
passing historic health reform package goal which confounded generations of
previous presidents
but without votes of senate insurance the prospects for passing the
legislation seem uncertain at best and brown has promised to be the st
republican vote to derail health care reform if he wins
think you can make pretty good argument that health care might be dead
representative anthony weiner told msnbc television on tuedsay
win for brown would also likely have wider implications for obama agenda and
political prestige and possibly call into doubt his ability to pass items like
cap and trade climate legislation and immigration reform
republican victory would also likely scare some conservative democrats away
from obama side as they face mid term congressional polls in november with
the president approval ratings slipping and the economy in the mire
the reality of it is that people of boston have very definite idea of what
they want and what they don want said republican national committee chairman
michael steele
think the administration has erred on the wrong side of that particular
equation and people are sending sound signal steele said on cbs
the white house has been arguing that the massachusetts vote is not referendum
on obama pointing out he still enjoys high approval in the state
they also reject the idea voters are out to thwart his bid to rein in insurance
companies cut costs and grant health care to of the million americans who
currently lack it
incredibly obama faces this perilous situation just year after his january
inauguration which saw democrats in control of both congress and the
white house and predictions new progressive era was dawning
as voting began at am gmt the latest public policy polling survey gave
brown percent of the vote to coakley percent
another poll commissioned by the politico website showed the republican ahead
percent to percent
democrats were hoping that supporters would shrug off disappointment with the
coakley campaign which some partisans say took victory for granted and
come out to back obama in state he won by landslide in november
democratic alarm over massachusetts became clear when obama took time off from
the haiti earthquake crisis to put his prestige on the line and campaign for
coakley on sunday
several voters questioned at boston polling station tuesday said they would
back coakley
voted for coakley because democrat and because of health care
continue to support obama agenda said leon martinez
an estimated to million voters were expected to turn out on tuesday
despite light snow falling in the boston area polls were not due to close until
pm gmt with nervous night ahead for both candidates
