kraft gobbles cadbury in mega takeover
london jan afp
british chocolate bar maker cadbury melted into the arms of us giant kraft on
tuesday in multi billion dollar deal to create world leader in food and
confectionery that sparked fears of job losses
cadbury management has agreed to an improved takeover offer worth pence per
share the companies announced in statement valuing the british group at
about billion pounds billion euros billion dollars
the friendly takeover marks the end of prolonged and bitter battle for control
of cadbury which is steeped in history and nostalgia and whose products are
loved by millions of sweet toothed customers worldwide
cadbury which began life as small grocer shop in birmingham central
england in spans countries with staff helping to make and sell
top selling brands dairy milk bars cadbury creme eggs and roses chocolates
cadbury led by chief executive todd stitzer an american had repeatedly
rejected kraft arguing that its previous cash and shares offer was derisory
and had undervalued the london listed firm
but kraft emerged victorious on tuesday despite opposition from senior
government ministers and trade unions over move by huge us firm to take over
british company deemed monument to the chocolate bar
we believe the offer represents good value for cadbury shareholders and are
pleased with the commitment that kraft foods has made to our heritage values
and people throughout the world said cadbury chairman roger carr
we will now work with the kraft foods management to ensure the continued
success and growth of the business for the benefit of our customers consumers
and employees
the new firm will create global market leader with over confectionery
brands each with annual sales of more than million dollars
but worries about job losses deepened after the pair admitted that they would
make significant cost savings
if the deal is approved by regulators and shareholders the combined group will
remould the chocolate sector and eclipse us firm mars which is currently the
biggest confectionery company in the world
investors welcomed tuesday news sending cadbury share price percent
higher to pence in late trading on london benchmark ftse index
which was slightly lower
under the deal kraft will pay pence in cash and new kraft foods
shares per cadbury share
cadbury shareholders will also receive pence per share in special dividend
if the takeover is successful including this dividend the improved kraft offer
is worth billion pounds
but the takeover will end more than years of history and independence for
the colourful maker of chocolate bar brands crunchie fudge flake and wispa as
well as halls throat sweets and trident chewing gum
kraft previous bid had valued the iconic british firm at about billion
pounds
kraft foods believes combination with cadbury will provide the potential for
meaningful cost savings and revenue synergies from which cadbury security
holders will benefit the statement said
kraft foods believes combination represents strong and complementary
strategic fit creating global confectionery leader with portfolio of more
than confectionery brands each with annual sales in excess of million
dollars
in reaction to the announcement british prime minister gordon brown said that
his government was determined to help save jobs at cadbury
cadbury employs about staff at eight factories in britain and ireland
there have been fears about british job losses with trade union unite warning
kraft would be saddled with huge debts leading them to axe posts at
cadbury and at the company sub contractors
markets were meanwhile waiting to see if us chocolate maker hershey would table
its own offer for cadbury the wall street journal last friday reported that
hershey planned to bid at least billion dollars this week
there has also been talk of possible joint bid for cadbury from hershey and
italian chocolate maker ferrero
cadbury dairy milk is the most popular chocolate bar in britain and the
company sells more than million bars every year in countries around the
world
kraft the world second biggest snacks group after nestle makes numerous
well known products including dairylea cheese milka and toblerone chocolate and
oreo cookies
this recommended offer represents compelling opportunity for cadbury
shareholders providing both immediate value certainty and upside potential in
the combined company said kraft boss irene rosenfeld
haiti faces heightened malaria risk global ranking
paris jan afp
already at high risk for malaria haiti faces an even greater likelihood that
the disease will spread after the january quake that killed at least
according to an assessment obtained on tuesday by afp
it is highly probable that the prevalence of malaria will increase in the wake
of the disaster said fiona place researcher at british risk analysis
specialists maplecroft and co author of the malaria risk index
overcrowding in the camps for the displaced inadequate shelter and sanitation
overburdened medical facilities ruptured sewer systems all these factors
provide favourable conditions for the breeding of malaria vectors place told
afp
improvised use of open air catchments for rainwater also make it easy for the
mosquitoes that carry the disease to multiply she said
containing malaria spread would partly depend on how fast aid agencies could
provide long lasting insecticidal nets set up basic health care and distribute
drugs and supplies she added
dysentery measles and other mosquito borne diseases such as dengue fever as
well as tb influenza and other respiratory infections already lurk in haiti and
have ample means to spread among those who are weak or in poor health living in
the street or in cramped rooms experts say
the maplecroft index ranks more than countries most affected by malaria
based on criteria including the number of cases deaths of children under
five use of nets and distribution of drugs
capacity to contain an outbreak is also taken into account
all but six of the countries hit hardest are in africa
those most in peril in the extreme risk category are democratic republic of
congo angola yemen burkina faso togo comoros and chad
prior to the richter scale earthquake haiti ranked th which put it in the
high category of risk
the largest non african country at high risk is pakistan according to the
study
its rating falls down most on malaria prevention in terms of its distribution
of nets indoor residual spraying and medicinal treatment place said
pakistan is also susceptible because its vast irrigation networks and monsoon
rains provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes
an estimated million cases of malaria around the world in led to almost
deaths according the world health organisation who
almost percent of those deaths were in africa and percent were children
under five years of age
the remaining percent of fatalities were evenly divided between southeast
asia and the eastern mediterranean
the use of insecticide treated nets for sleeping and the careful use of indoor
insecticides are cheap and effective ways of preventing infection recent
initiatives have shown
africa is most vulnerable because of the combined factors of favourable
conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes and inadequate resources to protect
the population from the disease spread
the high prevalence of hiv aids which depresses the immune system increases
susceptibility to malaria as well
global warming is also set to push malaria into new regions according to
scientists
temperature rise of only to degrees celsius to degrees
fahrenheit would be enough to facilitate the migration of malarial mosquitoes
further north particularly in africa they say

us missile strike kills five in pakistan officials
miranshah pakistan jan afp
us drone missile attack tuesday killed at least five suspected militants in
the th such strike targeting pakistan northwest taliban strongholds this
month security officials said
the missiles pounded militant compound in village kilometres miles
west of miranshah the main town in the north waziristan tribal region
pakistan lawless tribal belt runs along the afghan border and washington has
branded it the most dangerous place in the world rife with taliban and al
qaeda linked militants plotting attacks on western targets
two missiles fired by us drone hit compound which was being used by
militants said senior security official in the area
five militants were killed in the strike one missile hit the compound and the
other hit nearby vehicle three people sitting in the car were killed and two
others were killed in the compound
another security official confirmed the strike and casualties in degan village
neither official wanted to be named because of the sensitivity of the strikes
which fuel anti american sentiment in the muslim nation
it is not clear if any high value target was present in the area at the time of
the attack the official said
volley of drone strikes has hit the northwest this month all in north
waziristan bastion of al qaeda fighters the taliban and the haqqani network
known for staging attacks on us and nato troops in afghanistan
officials familiar with degan said it was also stronghold of hafiz gul
bahadur militant close to the taliban who is reputed to control up to
fighters whom he sends across the border to attack troops in afghanistan
number of us strikes last week are reported to have targeted pakistani taliban
leader hakimullah mehsud but he dispelled rumours of his death in an audio
recording saturday also vowing revenge for the drone programme
more than people have been killed in about us drone strikes in pakistan
since august
the bombings by unmanned us aircraft have soared recently as us president
barack obama puts pakistan at the heart of his administration fight against
al qaeda and islamist extremists
the pakistani government publicly condemns the strikes but us officials say they
are necessary to protect foreign soldiers stationed in afghanistan and say
number of high value extremists have been killed in the bombing raids
hakimullah mehsud predecessor baitullah mehsud was killed in us drone
strike last august
washington is also pressing islamabad to tackle militants who use pakistani soil
to launch attacks in afghanistan where about troops under us and nato
command are battling taliban insurgency
last year pakistan armed forces launched multiple assaults on taliban
strongholds across the tribal belt but up until now there have only been limited
operations in north waziristan
karzai orders security review after taliban attacks
kabul jan afp
afghan president hamid karzai on tuesday ordered review of security in the
capital after audacious attacks by taliban militants highlighted the
vulnerability of the city defences
karzai called in security officials to discuss how the islamist militants could
have brought their war to the gates of his fortified palace on monday morning
gunmen and suicide bombers bringing the city to standstill
security forces were put on high alert after the blitz on commercial and
government buildings in the most spectacular assault by the taliban in year
that left raging fires and saw pitched street battles
the attacks have thrown into question karzai plan to bring the militants in
from the cold and cast shadow over an international conference on
afghanistan future
five people were killed including child and four members of the security
forces along with seven of the militants
after security briefings by the ministers of defence and interior it was
agreed that the current security plan for kabul be reviewed and that they report
back to the president for approval presidential statement said
as the clean up of kabul was under way residents and analysts voiced concern
about security
kabul is big city with five million inhabitants mainly poor people and the
taliban and al qaeda can take advantage of it and infiltrate the city said
analyst haroun mir
shopkeeper fahim whose store in the qari sami mall was destroyed when the
building was stormed and set ablaze said he had lost everything and blamed the
government for allowing the attack to happen
the taliban succeeded here they have shown what they can do he told afp
while the afghan authorities investigated how the bombers could penetrate the
commercial and political heart of the city security forces won praise for
averting potentially far greater loss of life
afghan national security forces effectively dealt with the situation and should
be commended said us general stanley mcchrystal commander of international
forces in afghanistan sentiment echoed by the nato chief
karzai declared that the afghan security forces which are set to stand on
their own within five years had brought the situation under control after
three hours
but the attack was highly symbolic as it struck the only part of afghanistan
controlled by local forces just as the western backed karzai was swearing in
ministers for his new cabinet
the taliban said tuesday the attack aimed to send several messages and was timed
to coincide with the swearing in ceremony
purported spokesman zabihullah mujahid told afp the attacks proved the
taliban can be bought off with money they wage jihad and heed the orders of
god
more troops are not the solution he said in an apparent reference to the
extra soldiers being deployed to afghanistan this year by the us and nato
to reinforce the international troops already fighting the taliban
seven of our people proved what we can do mujahid said
the attacks also sent message to the international community before the
london conference telling them that they have invested in an administration that
is not capable he said speaking by telephone from an unknown location
karzai is due to announce new reconciliation plan this week before major
international conference in london on january but monday attacks cast
doubt on its chances for success
wadir safi kabul university political science professor said the taliban
show of force meant karzai did not have grip on the reconciliation process
the attacks happened at time when karzai has plan for the taliban but he
doesn have contact with the important ones
it long process there are taliban in and around kabul they are here and
can obviously be activated
afghanistan intelligence chief amrullah saleh said the taliban were not able
to fight face to face
but he conceded terrorist attacks are phenomenon that unfortunately we will
be facing for long time
debt ridden japan airlines declares bankruptcy
tokyo jan afp
japan airlines went bankrupt tuesday with billion dollars of debt in one of
the country biggest ever corporate failures beginning painful overhaul
involving more than job cuts
jal once proud flag carrier now worth less than jumbo jet reassured
passengers its flights would not be interrupted during the bankruptcy which is
similar to the process used to revive ailing us auto giant general motors
asia biggest airline which carries more than million passengers every
year will slash percent of its workforce and receive almost billion
dollars of public funds and emergency loans under three year turnaround plan
jal said it aimed to be reborn as leading airline group while transport
minister seiji maehara warned tokyo would not keep bailing the company out
jal will have to fly on its own after three years he said looking to the
future for the aviation industry we have to determine if two mega carriers
should exist or not
japan top carrier has fared much worse than smaller rival all nippon airways
in recent years
its shares plunged to an all time low of just three yen three us cents at one
point tuesday reducing the market value of the group to about million
dollars less than even the cost of new boeing jumbo
the stock will be delisted from the tokyo stock exchange on february or
earlier move expected to wipe out shareholders investments
even so analysts said bankruptcy appeared to have been the best option
filing for bankruptcy protection was done in quick and transparent way and
this is positive for jal business outlook said mitsushige akino fund
manager at ichiyoshi investment management co
the approach of the four month old government contrasts with the approach of
previous conservative administrations which simply threw money at jal to keep
it afloat he said
jal made no announcement regarding its tie up talks with american airlines and
delta air lines which are in bidding war for slice of the carrier eyeing
its lucrative asian landing slots
delta said it and the skyteam airline alliance fully support japan airlines and
stand ready to provide assistance and support in any way possible
american airlines said jal bankruptcy would not affect the japanese carrier
current relationship with the oneworld alliance
but all nippon airways said it was highly concerned that fair and competitive
environment would not be secured by the use of public funds in the rescue plan
kyodo news reported
the government has tapped kazuo inamori year old entrepreneur to run the
stricken airline during its overhaul replacing haruka nishimatsu who resigned
as president tuesday
nishimatsu bowed in apology at news conference but said he was optimistic jal
could weather the storm
my biggest regret was that we failed to deal with changing demand he said
firmly believe jal can once again survive the intensifying competition and
become an aviation company that represents japan
inamori is one of japan most respected business executives and management
gurus having founded electronics maker kyocera and company that later became
part of kddi now japan number two telecoms firm
the collapse of the carrier once pillar of japan inc has raised concerns
among japanese about the broader woes of their economy which is back in
deflation and set to be overtaken by china as the world number two
with jal bankruptcy people are becoming increasingly gloomy about the
economy hideharu seiyama year old regular jal passenger told afp at
tokyo haneda airport
jal carried the country on its back and it was known the government would foot
the bill so it was managed on the assumption it would never fail
jal went bust with debts of about trillion yen billion dollars
becoming one of the highest profile victims of japan long economic malaise
the airline is expected to post massive operating loss of about billion
dollars in the current financial year to march according to the state backed
body overseeing its turnaround efforts
creditors will forgive billion yen of debt and the airline said it was
confident it could swiftly revitalise its business under the corporate
rehabilitation law japan version of chapter in the united states
it aims to retire its boeing jumbo and switch to more fuel efficient
aircraft
