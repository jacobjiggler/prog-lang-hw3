google postpones launch of mobiles in china dow jones
beijing jan afp
google on tuesday postponed the launch of two mobile handsets in china one week
after threatening to leave the asian giant over cyberattacks and censorship dow
jones newswires reported
the us company said in statement to dow jones that the phones featuring
google android operating system and developed in cooperation with motorola and
samsung had been scheduled to be unveiled wednesday with china unicom
the california based internet firm did not specify when or if the launch would
take place
person familiar with the situation told dow jones the company felt it would be
irresponsible to release the phones at the current time given the current
uncertainty
representatives of google were not immediately available to comment when
contacted by afp
google said last week it was considering abandoning its chinese search engine
and could shut its china offices over theft of its intellectual property by
hackers allegedly based there
the company says it is no longer willing to bow to chinese internet censors by
filtering search results on google cn but is still seeking talks with beijing
on solution
when asked about the status of talks on tuesday chinese foreign ministry
spokesman ma zhaoxu said he was not aware of the situation and countered that
china was in fact the biggest victim of hacking activities in the world
the spokesman also reiterated that foreign firms operating in china need to
follow china laws and regulations respect the interests of the general public
and shoulder the corresponding responsibilities
google is not an exception he said
google said the cyberattacks were likely aimed at gaining access to the gmail
accounts of chinese human rights activists but has said it does not believe
that goal was achieved
the company said more than other unidentified firms were targeted in the
highly sophisticated attacks believed to have originated in china while
other reports have put the number of companies attacked at more than
the row has threatened to rattle ties between washington and beijing already
frayed over number of issues from the copenhagen climate change debacle to
the value of the chinese yuan and number of other trade disputes
the united states has informally asked for an explanation from beijing over the
google dispute and could launch formal diplomatic request on the issue as
soon as this week the state department has said
chinese commerce ministry spokesman said last week the row would not affect
overall trade and economic relations between china and the united states
google android mobile operating system has been featured in number of
phones starting with mobile in october and more recently with the
droid from motorola
the company earlier this month unveiled its own nexus one smartphone in the
united states in direct challenge to apple iphone handsets
iceland to hold icesave referendum on march govt
reykjavik jan afp
iceland will hold referendum on march on controversial compensation deal
for britain and the netherlands for the icesave bank collapse the government
said on tuesday
voting day for the national referendum on the future value of the law no
will be march the government said in its official agenda in
reference to the so called icesave bill
the bill narrowly approved by the icelandic parliament on december defines
the terms of the payout of billion euros billion dollars to london and
the hague for having compensated more than british and dutch savers who
lost money in the collapse of the icelandic bank
president olafur ragnar grimsson refused to sign the bill into law earlier this
month referring the issue to referendum instead because of public opposition
moody maintains negative outlook on greece
paris jan afp
international rating agency moody said on tuesday it was maintaining
negative outlook on greece because it was unclear whether the government could
implement plan to shore up public finances
given the lack of certainty surrounding the the greek government ability to
implement the programme moody negative outlook remains unchanged the agency
said
the greek government which last month suffered credit downgrade from all
three leading ratings agencies is struggling to overcome huge debt and public
deficit that have sparked consternation among its eurozone partners
greek authorities last week presented the european commission with plan to
rein in spending and restore credibility which moody described as relatively
well designed
for that reason the agency added it was maintaining its current rating on
greek government bonds
but the key challenge is implementation
the plans for that are detailed in the plan appear achievable moody
said
but the heavy legislative programme for the first quarter of and greece
poor track record in implementing fiscal reform mean that success cannot be
taken for granted
it also questioned whether that greek electorate will tolerate years of fiscal
austerity
the last action by moody on greece came on december when it cut the
government bond ratings from to
greece has public spending deficit that rose to percent of output last
year far above the percent ceiling for countries using the euro currency
it is also saddled with debt constituting percent of gross domestic
product
the socialist government which came to power in october last week unveiled
three year crisis blueprint to cut back public deficit of over billion
euros billion dollars and rein in government debt estimated to exceed
billion euros this year
the plan aims to save more than billion euros in with improved tax
collection cost cuts and reduced arms spending to bring the public deficit to
percent of output by
greek credibility has also suffered because of its past provision of unreliable
economic data and european finance ministers on tuesday were expected to tell
athens to clean up its accounting and improve the administration of key
institutions
moody on tuesday noted with approval that the greek programme called for cut
of percent in allowances which form part of the pay of civil servants
as these allowances would be taxed at the same rate as base salaries the net
take home pay of civil servants is due to fall by more than the headline
percent cut in gross allowances suggests the agency said
it also pointed to government plan to reduce the number of civil servants by
hiring only one new employee for every five who retire
but overall according to moody determining whether the plan will succeed
or fail is particularly challenging given the weak credibility of the government
and debt statistics
greece fiscal statistics have been undermined by years of mismanagement and
sometimes deliberate misreporting

melbourne jan afp

victory over spaniard daniel gimeno traver at the australian open on tuesday
the serbian third seed fought back from an early break in the opening set to
claim win over the th ranked spaniard in just over two hours
djokovic who won the australian title cruised through the remaining sets
with break in the second and two others in the final set to clinch victory
djokovic path in his quarter was cleared somewhat by the upset loss of swedish
eighth seed robin soderling and th spanish seed tommy robredo earlier tuesday
the serb is looking for strong opening grand slam of the season after he was
forced to withdraw in last year open when the defending champion in his
quarter final with andy roddick because of heat distress
djokovic scored stunning win over roger federer in the semi finals of the
australian open on the way to winning his first grand slam but he has not
played in the last seven major finals dominated by federer and rafael nadal
but under american coach todd martin he is working on creating more rounded
game to push his way into grand slam contention

company
