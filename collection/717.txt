un security council eyes more peacekeepers for haiti
united nations jan afp
the security council was expected tuesday to approve request for extra
un troops and police to be deployed to haiti amid scenes of lawlessness on the
streets of the stricken capital port au prince
un secretary general ban ki moon has called for his organization battered
peacekeeping mission to haiti to be reinforced as he briefed the council
member states on his recent six hour visit to the haitian capital
ban call comes amid fears that survivors desperation over the slow pace of
aid could spill over into widespread violence in country that has long
running security troubles
thousands of homeless haitians were prey to roving bands of looters swarming
through the ruins of port au prince with police and military officials tasked
with protecting the vulnerable populace nowhere to be found
ban said he had requested that the un mission known as minustah which had
its headquarters destroyed in the january earthquake be considerably
beefed up from its previous levels of around security and civilian
personnel
recommended that the security council boost the number of troops by
nearly percent increase for six months and that the number of un police
officers should rise by or percent he said
diplomats said the council would meet tuesday morning to adopt draft
resolution to that effect proposed by the united states
copy of the text obtained by afp endorsed ban reinforcement request and
said minustah will consist of military component of up to troops of
all ranks and of police component of up to
french ambassador gerard araud said the security council would also have to
examine minustah mandate in the near future to see what is necessary to
adjust it to the new situation
he noted that paris had proposed an international conference on rebuilding the
haitian economy and said the talks should ideally be held in march after
preparatory meeting in montreal scheduled for monday
alain leroy head of un peacekeeping operations said the extra troops would be
used to build humanitarian corridors to link port au prince with the neighboring
dominican republic and northern haitian port
the haitian capital main port was heavily damaged in tuesday quake and
will require weeks if not months of repairs
the extra minustah troops would also serve as reserve force in case the
security situation deteriorates leroy said
extra police would include forensic experts and prison officers including more
than to deal with detainees who escaped leroy said their mission
would generally be to back up the haitian police
leroy said the dominican republic had agreed to dispatch battalion of
troops for arrival as early as this week and that other countries notably from
latin america and the european union were considering offers
he also addressed the sensitive issue of coordination between minustah and the
some troops being deployed by the united states
leroy said there was clear division of labor with minustah in charge of
general security in haiti and the us troops there to secure their huge
humanitarian operation
susana malcorra head of the un department of field support logistics
stressed the need to open up alternative aid routes to the badly damaged and
overrun port au prince airport the main entry point for international aid
the un mission in haiti has roughly troops police and about
civilian personnel
it has been deployed since mid to help stabilize the impoverished caribbean
island nation of nine million people where officials fear the final death toll
could soar above
quarter of million more were injured and million left homeless in the
wake of the magnitude quake
the disaster was also the worst yet in terms of fatalities for the united
nations and ban spokesman martin nesirky said un personnel were now
confirmed dead and more than missing or unaccounted for
the heartbreaking things saw yesterday compel us to act swiftly and
generously ban said
the un chief said he got clear message from his encounter with haitians who
told him we need the united nations we need jobs we need food and water
he said the priority was to improve the coordination of the massive
international relief effort and unclog the bottlenecks to make sure that the aid
was reaching the people who needed it most
ban late sunday flew back from port au prince with the remains of his special
envoy to haiti hedi annabi and his brazilian deputy luiz carlos da costa both
killed in the quake
the un boss made the morale boosting visit to the haitian capital to show
solidarity with haitian quake victims and shell shocked local un staff
he visited the flattened minustah headquarters to praise the work of some
rescue workers battling to save as many lives as possible and to offer comfort
to the staff

moody maintains negative outlook on greece
paris jan afp
international rating agency moody said on tuesday it was maintaining
negative outlook on greece because it was unclear whether the government could
implement plan to shore up public finances
given the lack of certainty surrounding the the greek government ability to
implement the programme moody negative outlook remains unchanged the agency
said
the greek government which last month suffered credit downgrade from all
three leading ratings agencies is struggling to overcome huge debt and public
deficit that have sparked consternation among its eurozone partners
greek authorities last week presented the european commission with plan to
rein in spending and restore credibility which moody described as relatively
well designed
for that reason the agency added it was maintaining its current rating on
greek government bonds
but the key challenge is implementation
the plans for that are detailed in the plan appear achievable moody
said
but the heavy legislative programme for the first quarter of and greece
poor track record in implementing fiscal reform mean that success cannot be
taken for granted
it also questioned whether that greek electorate will tolerate years of fiscal
austerity

iran says world powers showing realism on nuclear issue
tehran jan afp
iran said on tuesday that world powers involved in un backed talks on tehran
controversial nuclear programme were showing traces of realism after they
failed to decide on new sanctions
china meanwhile urged flexibility on the standoff over iran nuclear drive
and return to negotiations
in tehran foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told reporters
speaking of sanctions is repetitive and it is not constructive
some western countries should correct their approach and be realistic about
our nuclear rights and we feel there are traces of realism to be seen he
added
mehmanparast was echoing comments on monday by the islamic republic foreign
minister manouchehr mottaki
we are ready to help with the realistic approach and at the same time we will
wait for public and back stage developments on iran nuclear case mottaki
said
world powers made up of the five permanent members of the un security council
plus germany met in new york on saturday but failed to reach an agreement about
new sanctions against tehran over its nuclear defiance
the six are concerned about tehran rejection of un brokered deal under which
most of iran low enriched uranium leu stockpile would be shipped abroad to
be further enriched into reactor fuel
iran has come up with its own counter proposal of staged and simultaneous swap
of leu with nuclear reactor fuel this has been largely rejected by world
powers insisting tehran accept the international atomic energy agency offer
the new york meeting brought together senior officials from britain france
germany russia and the united states
but china signaling its reluctance to back tougher sanctions pushed by the
west sent lower level diplomat winning praise from tehran
in beijing mehmanparast opposite number ma zhaoxu said china has all
along proposed the proper settlement of the iran nuclear issue through dialogue
and consultation
we hope relevant parties can enhance consultations show flexibility and
promote the early peaceful solution of the relevant issue in proper manner
he told reporters
washington and its western allies fear that iran is secretly developing fissile
material for nuclear weapons under the cover of its uranium enrichment
programme
tehran which is already under three sets of sanctions for refusing to suspend
enrichment vehemently denies the charge
the chinese foreign ministry spokesman said his country was aware of the
proliferation concerns of the western nations but insisted iran had the right to
the peaceful use of nuclear energy
under fire bulgarian eu commission nominee pulls out
strasbourg jan afp
bulgaria under fire eu commission nominee has withdrawn her bid and resigned
as her country foreign minister the head of the centre right group in the
european parliament announced tuesday
learnt this morning that mrs jeleva is withdrawing from her functions as
bulgarian foreign minister and as commissioner designate for the humanitarian
aid portfolio european people party head joseph daul said during press
conference in strasbourg
rumiana jeleva came under fire from members of the european parliament during
confirmation hearing last week over both her competence for the post and
allegations of gaps in her declaration of financial interests
sofia swiftly proposed senior world bank official kristalina georgieva as its
new eu commission pick eu commission chief jose manuel barroso said
barroso took note of jeleva withdrawal which came amid accusations of
incompetence and allegations that she falsified her declaration of financial
interests
bulgarian prime minister boyko borisov has in the meantime informed president
barroso of his intention to suggest ms kristalina georgieva currently vice
president of the world bank as member of the european commission the
commission said in statement
barroso welcomes the swift reaction of the bulgarian government to this
situation the statement continued adding that the process of putting together
his new member policy commission should now continue and be concluded at the
earliest opportunity
the socialist group in the eu parliament which has led the criticism against
jeleva called her decision to withdraw inevitable and predictable
her decision to go is the best outcome for everyone including herself said
socialist leader martin schulz
after such poor performance in the parliamentary which highlighted her
incompetence this outcome was both inevitable and predictable he added
regret the way in which the epp group tried desperately to save her despite
her performance it was serious mistake to put political allegiance before
basic competence to do the job he stormed
barroso who has begun second five year term in office said he would meet her
proposed replacement georgieva as soon as possible in the hope that the
timetable will not slip for his new cabinet to be up and running by february
over the last week and half the european parliament has grilled all eu
commissioners to be while jeleva was not the only one to face some tough
grilling it was clear that she posed the biggest hurdle to barroso new
executive team coming into being
the meps cannot veto any particular commissioner delegate but can block the
whole team if they are not happy
several european deputies criticise jeleva for giving vague answers or worse to
questions on her area of competence during the original parliamentary hearing on
january
report by the parliament legal experts did not reveal any problems with her
most recent financial declaration though it did suggest problems with earlier
versions she lodged while member of the european parliament from
however by then the focus had switched firmly to her ability to hold down the
humanitarian and crisis aid portfolio which will take in the eu response to
the massive earthquake in haiti
