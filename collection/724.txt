syria
the peace envoy was set to meet with lebanese president michel sleiman prime
minister saad hariri foreign minister ali shami and number of other officials
before leaving beirut on wednesday
israel maariv newspaper said early january that washington was pushing plan
to restart peace talks that foresees reaching final deal in two years and
agreeing on permanent borders in nine months
under the plan the israelis and palestinians will immediately start final
status talks that were suspended during the gaza war year ago maariv
reported citing unnamed sources
mitchell last visited lebanon in june vowing at the time that washington would
not sacrifice the tiny mediterranean country as it seeks to reach comprehensive
peace in the middle east
us envoys visits are criticised by lebanon shiite hezbollah which the united
states lists as terrorist organisation

radio interview saying they did not serve the interests of lebanon
mitchell latest mideast tour comes less than week after us president barack
obama national security adviser james jones held talks with palestinian and
israeli leaders aimed at furthering us led peace efforts
obama has been struggling to get the two sides back to the negotiating table
since he assumed office nearly year ago but has thus far failed to get israel
to completely halt settlements or secure arab concessions to the jewish state

charged with gross indecency saying they were being tried in court of law
and under existing laws
we are sovereign country with own laws information minister leckford thotho
said
our laws criminalise homosexuality and what the two did was clearly breaking
the laws of malawi thotho said in statement
the government was reacting for the first time three weeks after tiwonge
chimbalanga and steven monjeza were arrested and charged with gross
indecency after conducting malawi first public gay wedding
the two who face up to years in prison if convicted have pleaded not guilty
to the charge but are still in police custody after magistrates court denied
them bail
despite malawi depending on international aid the country is sovereign
country with its own laws and must not be influenced by the west in the running
of its affairs of state said thotho
as government we cannot interfere in the court process we depend on our
western friends yes but we are sovereign country with our own laws
the men laywers have argued that the penal code under which they were charged
is unconstitutional as it is against the spirit of the constitution
last week the pair asked the constitutional court to hear their case arguing
that their detention violated their legally protected rights
but the judge hearing their case insisted on proceeding with their trial until
the higher court decides whether to accept their appeal the trial resumes on
monday
monjeza and chimbalanga five month relationship has shocked the conservative
nation where homosexuality is banned and where sex topics are still largely
taboo
the pair has not applied for legal recognition of their wedding

health crisis also loomed as week after the magnitude tremor aid workers
struggled to tend to the homeless and injured amid deteriorating security in the
stricken capital port au prince
the united nations said tuesday more than people had been pulled out alive so
far but with hopes of finding any more survivors in the rubble fading relief
efforts were focusing on the estimated quarter of million injured and
million left homeless

un troops and police to be deployed to help curb lawlessness
even as pledges of improved security were made thousands of homeless haitians
were prey to roving bands of looters swarming through the ruins of port au
prince with police and military officials tasked with protecting the vulnerable
populace nowhere to be found
officials have expressed fears the final death toll may top if it is
ever known at all while government minister said sunday that bodies
had already been buried
lucky few survivors received treatment from surgeons on us navy ship

countries should lead and coordinate efforts by the international community of
haiti donors and other parties brazilian government official said
eu nations promised more than million dollars in aid and reconstruction
funds but dominican president leonel fernandez estimated billion dollars over
five years would be needed to help haiti recover
in the stinking capital port au prince where corpses lay abandoned under the
rubble and palace gardens were turned into putrid slums groups of survivors
roamed the streets to scrounge supplies
troops in combat gear fired off rounds and hauled some people to the ground to
try to stop the worst of the pillaging
looters roamed from shop to shop some clearly survivors scavenging for food and
water as the unrest across the region was stoked by delay in supplies
reaching the hundreds of thousands who have been without steady source of food
or water since the quake struck
