of president barack obama ambitious reform agenda
the special election to fill the seat of the late democratic veteran edward
kennedy could see republican scott brown score stunning upset against democrat
martha coakley in what was believed to be one of her party safest seats
the latest public policy polling survey conducted over the weekend gives brown
percent to coakley percent while poll commissioned by the politico
website showed the republican ahead to percent
another poll showed the two neck and neck
the stakes are huge not so much for who will represent the northeastern state
but because win by brown would demolish the fragile supermajority democrats
use in the senate to override opposition to health care reform and the rest of
obama agenda
with senate votes democrats are able to prevent republican filibusters and
push through legislation with only democrats would need republican support
which in today increasingly rancorous partisan divide looks unlikely to
happen
the president showed his alarm sunday when he took time off from the haiti
earthquake crisis and other pressing issues to campaign in boston
he told noisy crowd of coakley supporters that the big initiatives of his
presidency the health care plan clean energy initiatives and attempts to
repair the damage from last year financial meltdown are on the line
lot of these measures are going to rest on one vote in the united states
senate obama said that why the opponents of change and progress have been
pouring money in
incredibly obama faces this perilous situation just year after his january
inauguration when he made lofty promise of cross party cooperation
republicans who took drubbing during the presidential and general
election now believe they are poised for comeback while democrats are
scared
most damaging of all to the democrats would be the collapse of their bogged down
health care reform plan the bill is said by the party to be almost ready for
passing but if that th senate vote is not there obama landmark initiative
could die
democrats are racing to draw up contingency plans for rapid passing of health
care in the event of losing the massachusetts seat but that would likely
provoke firestorm of republican complaints
republicans could start legal battle over the legitimacy politico reported
equally alarming for obama is the potential for this special election to herald
defeat in the nationwide mid term congressional elections in november
the president will try to regain some momentum when he addresses the nation on
january in his first state of the union address
especially troubling for democrats is brown popularity with independents
crucial factor in many elections across the country
registered democrats outnumber republicans three to one in massachusetts but
there are even more independents and public policy polling found that brown
leads to percent in that sector
also he is getting percent of the vote from people who backed obama in last
november presidential election while coakley is getting only four percent of
one time john mccain supporters
republican strategist bradley blakeman wrote on politico that if brown wins
then republicans will see the race as barometer of the storm that is coming
this fall for democrats throughout the country
the analytical rothenberg report said the result as usual in special elections
could depend on turnout and therefore is harder to predict
however the combination of public and private survey research and anecdotal
information now strongly suggests that republican scott brown will defeat
democrat martha coakley
insideradvantage which conducted the poll for politico claimed that coakley
was finished
actually think the bottom is falling out said insideradvantage ceo matt
towery think that this candidate is in freefall clearly this race is
imploding for her
in last minute bid to reverse that momentum coakley aired new tv campaign
ad monday featuring obama appearance on sunday in which he praised her
achievements that analysts said was aimed at getting the party base to hit
the polls
the white house insists that coakley can pull off victory and that health
care reform is safe
the plan to get health care passed is to continue to do what we re doing in
ironing out the differences between the house and senate spokesman robert
gibbs said sunday
said this on friday when was asked and ll say it on sunday on the ride
home we think martha coakley is going to win this race
us military leads surge in haiti relief effort
port au prince jan afp
us military surge and request for more un troops and police brought
glimmer of hope to despairing survivors still seeking basic supplies and
security tuesday week after the killer earthquake
even as pledges of improved security were made thousands of homeless haitians
were facing the very real threat of roving bands of looters swarming through the
ruins of port au prince with police and military officials tasked with
protecting the city nowhere to be found
more than marines arrived aboard the amphibious ship uss bataan boosting
overall us troop numbers to either in haiti or offshore
un secretary general ban ki moon also asked the security council to authorize
the deployment of extra un troops and police beyond the roughly
troops police and civilian personnel already here as part of the un
peacekeeping mission deployed since to help stabilize the country
approximately us troops were already on the ground overseeing the aid
effort and trying to provide desperately needed security us commanders promised
more than personnel in total would be in the disaster zone in the coming
weeks
we will stay as long as is required said major general cornell wilson we
are working in conjunction and coordination with un forces and the government of
haiti for security issues
the surge comes six days after magnitude quake devastated the city of
port au prince and surrounding areas leaving tens of thousands dead hundreds
of thousands homeless and countless injured haitian officials have warned that
may have perished
to back up relief for the thousands of wounded the us hospital ship comfort was
also expected to arrive tuesday
the armed military presence is certainly needed according to top us officials
and aid agencies
pillaging led haitian police to open fire in port au prince on sunday killing
one man as looters ransacked supermarket and violence flared
and the streets of the capital were largely lawless monday as desperate
survivors helped themselves to whatever they could find scattering only briefly
when isolated police officers fired shots in the air
looters roamed from shop to shop some clearly survivors scavenging for food and
water as the unrest across the region was stoked by delay in supplies
reaching the hundreds of thousands who have been without steady source of food
or water since the quake struck
the roaming gangs were stealing anything they could find sneakers fabric
music stereos
wanted to get my possessions from my house but the looters prevented me
wailed one distraught elderly man near what remains of his rubble strewn home
they ve already stolen almost everything own my rice my spaghetti my
milk the man said
the international committee of the red cross warned that incidents of violence
and looting are on the rise as the desperation grows
us commanders denied that security was deteriorating with lieutenant general
ken keen the top officer on the ground insisting the level of violence we
see now is below pre earthquake levels
would characterize the security situation in port au prince today as stable
agreed rear admiral michael rogers adding that were instances of isolated
events but no sense of widespread panic
us army paratroopers set off in waves of navy seahawk helicopters from their
main hub at port au prince airport to establish bases beyond the capital from
which to kickstart humanitarian operations
us military aircraft would be helping to distribute daily food rations
in the coming days officials said
in washington president barack obama called for joint us brazilian canadian
leadership for relief efforts
meanwhile food rations provided by the united nations and humanitarian
organizations began to trickle out to desperate recipients including at challe
camp for displaced haitians but one desperate father there said the
aid was not nearly enough to feed so many hungry people
tuesday quake destroyed the main port spilling wharves huge cranes steel
containers and other heavy equipment into the shallow bay
captain james mcpherson of the us coast guard acknowledged air relief was the
only way to make food and water deliveries until an alternative to boat drop
offs could be found
what we need to do is restore the port get cargo moving mcpherson told cnn
obviously ship can move multiple tons of cargo we need to do that for the
long term success of haiti
us southern command said rescue and salvage vessel had arrived monday and
would send down divers to assess the port damage
salvage operation would follow to clear channel debris but the huge
undertaking was expected to take weeks if not months

iran says world powers showing realism on nuclear issue
tehran jan afp
iran said on tuesday that world powers involved in un backed talks on tehran
controversial nuclear programme were showing traces of realism after they
failed to decide on new sanctions
speaking of sanctions is repetitive and it is not constructive foreign
ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told reporters
some western countries should correct their approach and be realistic about
our nuclear rights and we feel there are traces of realism to be seen he
added
mehmanparast was echoing comments on monday by the islamic republic foreign
minister manouchehr mottaki
we are ready to help with the realistic approach and at the same time we will
wait for public and back stage developments on iran nuclear case mottaki
told reporters
world powers made up of the five permanent members of the un security council
plus germany met in new york on saturday but failed to reach an agreement about
new sanctions against tehran over its nuclear defiance
the six are concerned about tehran rejection of un brokered deal under which
most of iran low enriched uranium leu stockpile would be shipped abroad to
be further enriched into reactor fuel
iran has come up with its own counter proposal of staged and simultaneous swap
of leu with nuclear reactor fuel this has been largely rejected by world
powers insisting tehran accept the international atomic energy agency offer
the new york meeting brought together senior officials from britain france
germany russia and the united states
but china signaling its reluctance to back tougher sanctions pushed by the
west sent lower level diplomat winning praise from tehran
washington and its western allies fear that iran is secretly developing fissile
material for nuclear weapons under the cover of its uranium enrichment
programme
tehran which is already under three sets of sanctions for refusing to suspend
enrichment vehemently denies the charge
