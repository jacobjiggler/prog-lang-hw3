the global economy is poised to grow percent this year after shrinking in

the world bank said the nascent recovery from the worst crisis since the great
depression was expected to slow later this year as the impact of fiscal
stimulus wanes

economist
the depth of the recession means that even though growth has returned
countries and individuals will continue to feel the pain of the crisis for years

key impediments to growth are troubled financial markets and sluggish private

hans timmer an author of the report said data indicates that unemployment will
only get worse
actually growth this year is not even strong enough to generate the jobs for
the new people that are coming on the global jobs market let alone that you
need to create employment for the people who have lost their jobs in

the recovery is fragile and expected to slow in the second half of as the
growth impact of fiscal and monetary measures wane and the current inventory
cycle runs its course said the poverty fighting bank
the world bank underscored the uncertainties about the strength and durability
of the recovery saying it would depend on how much household and business
sector demand firms over the next few quarters
neither double dip scenario where growth slows appreciably in or
strengthening recovery can be ruled out said the report
that assessment contradicted the view of the bank sibling institution the
international monetary fund whose managing director dominique strauss kahn
repeatedly has dismissed double dip scenario
developing countries are suffering high human cost because of the crisis the
bank said
as many as additional children may have died of malnutrition in and
by the end of million more people are expected to be living in poverty
than would have been the case without the crisis
the bank said an additional billion dollars in funding would be needed
just to maintain current levels of programming

achieving higher growth rates will require concerted efforts to increase
domestic productivity and lower the domestic cost of finance the chinese chief

world bank sees signs of bubbles in chinese economy
washington jan afp
the lead author of world bank report on the global economy published wednesday
said the bank sees signs of bubbles in the chinese economy problem he said
the chinese government acknowledges
we can already see some signs of bubbles and signs of tensions in the chinese
economy in particular in the housing sector said andrew burns head of the
bank macroeconomic forecasting at news briefing tuesday under embargo until
the report was released late wednesday in washington
the notion that asset bubbles are forming in china is controversial some
economists say that boom in housing prices in beijing and other major cities
reflects bubble while others say that signs of an overheating economy do not
presage the bursting of bubble
according to the world bank annual report global economic prospects the
chinese economy is projected to continue to lead global growth in at
pace of percent that would dwarf the global rate of percent
burns noted china low domestic interest rate and the particular nature of
its fiscal stimulus saying they were putting strains on the economy and
forcing the government to step back
hans timmer director of the bank group that produces the report said at the
news briefing that it is true that there are vulnerabilities of too much
stimulus in china and the chinese authorities are very aware of that
liu mingkang chairman of the china banking regulatory commission said
wednesday that china would rein in credit after explosive growth last year but
had no plans to stop banks lending as the nation moves to cool its red hot
economy
in the past year china adopted what it called moderately loose monetary
policy and embarked on an unprecedented four trillion yuan billion dollar
spending spree to keep the economy growing amid the global downturn
it also urged banks to pump up lending but after the amount of new loans
subsequently surged the government in recent months reversed course and called
for reasonable lending as inflation fears rose
robert zoellick the president of the world bank warned last september that
china rapid recovery in was fueled by an expansion of credit of
percent of gdp in the first eight months of the year
this flood is now easing and authorities are likely to limit it further for
fear of effects on asset prices asset quality and eventually general
inflation he said

brazil looks to double haiti peacekeepers to ministry
brasilia jan afp
brazil is looking to send hundreds more soldiers to its un peacekeeping
deployment in haiti potentially doubling the unit to men the defense
ministry said in statement
if congress approves the ministry request brazil could immediately send
personnel soldiers and police to boost the brazilian
peacekeepers already in the country as urged by the united nations
reserve of another troops could then be kept on standby in case the
situation warrants also sending them to the quake ravaged caribbean country

football coyle angered by gallas assault
london jan afp
bolton boss owen coyle accused william gallas of challenge closer to an
assault than tackle as arsenal went top of the english premier league with
home win here on wednesday
relegation threatened bolton took shock lead at the emirates stadium just
three days after losing to the gunners through gary cahill and penalty
from matthew taylor
but arsene wenger arsenal often accused of both mental frailty and lack of
physical presence pulled goal back before half time through tomas rosicky
in the second half they equalised in controversial fashion through captain cesc
fabregas after gallas appeared to foul mark davies in the build up with
challenge that left the bolton player with suspected broken ankle
then goals from thomas vermaelen and andrey arshavin not only secured victory
for arsenal but gave the gunners the two goal margin they needed to go above
london rivals chelsea at the top of the table
for coyle the way in which arsenal equalised was tough to take and the scot
told sky sports think it was closer to an assault than tackle would
suggest it probably closer to sending off as far as concerned
however the fact is the referee has not seen it and the lad is prostrate on
the ground and arsenal being full of fair play as we keep hearing have carried
on and scored an equaliser that is hard to take
coyle who said davies would have an ray added it was bad tackle there
is no getting away from it
you can accept it if he gets bit of the ball because that is the game we
play and it can happen but he has not touched any of the ball and it rubs salt
into the wounds
don want to sit here and make excuses but have seen red cards for less
wenger said am sorry if the tackle was not good and apologise
however to complain that we went on to play think that is unfair the
players did not even know what was happening behind them whether the player has
got up again or not
don believe you can kick the ball out every time player is down when you
win the ball that is why they changed the rules
arsenal were points off top spot after crushing defeat by chelsea at
the end of november and cautiously optimistic wenger said chelsea have
game in hand but it is good
we had two difficult games against bolton with new manager two cup games
almost and our mental and physical strength was tested again tonight
we are certainly much more physically resistant you cannot find team better
than bolton in doing what they did tonight they marked us man to man didn
give us an inch of space physically you are never better tested than against
bolton
only portsmouth are below bolton in the table but coyle said have seen
enough in the two games to suggest we have enough quality and if we work hard
we can survive

football arsenal go top liverpool eye champions league
london jan afp
arsenal went top of the english premier league after coming from down to
beat bolton wanderers on wednesday
the gunners needed to win by two clear goals to go ahead of chelsea on goal
difference but that looked unlikely as they fell two goals down inside half an
hour just three days after winning away to the same opponents
bolton went in front through gary cahill before matt taylor penalty doubled
their lead as they looked to give owen coyle his first win as manager
however arsenal pulled one back before half time through tomas rosicky before
goals from cesc fabregas thomas vermaelen and andrey arshavin sealed their
comeback at the emirates stadium
for us it was big mountain to climb in the two games against team with
new manager you get two cup games you needed special quality to win the two
games arsenal boss arsene wenger told sky sports
defeat left wanderers in the bottom three but french manager wenger added if
bolton play with that spirit and that commitment they will stay in the premier
league
meanwhile liverpool moved to within point of the top four and place in next
season champions league with win at home to fourth placed tottenham
hotspur at anfield
dutch striker dirk kuyt gave the merseysiders an early lead before making sure
of victory with stoppage time penalty as they put their fa cup exit at the
hands of second division reading and last weekend lacklustre draw with stoke
behind them
wednesday win was all the sweeter for liverpool as they were without injured
star players steven gerrard and fernando torres
