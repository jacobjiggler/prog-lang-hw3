arsenal went top of the english premier league after coming from down to
beat bolton wanderers on wednesday
the gunners needed to win by two clear goals to go ahead of chelsea on goal
difference but that looked unlikely as they fell two goals down inside half an
hour just three days after winning away to the same opponents
bolton went in front through gary cahill before matt taylor penalty doubled
their lead as they looked to give owen coyle his first win as manager
however arsenal pulled one back before half time through tomas rosicky before
goals from cesc fabregas thomas vermaelen and andrey arshavin sealed their
comeback at the emirates stadium
meanwhile liverpool moved to within point of the top four and place in next
season champions league with win at home to fourth placed tottenham
hotspur at anfield
dutch striker dirk kuyt gave the merseysiders an early lead before making sure
of victory with stoppage time penalty
at the emirates bolton needed just seven minutes to take the lead when cahill
scored from kevin davies flick on
bolton doubled their lead in the th minute when lee chung yong was brought
down in the box by denilson and taylor scored from the penalty spot
but arsenal reduced the deficit in the rd minute when rosicky fired in shot
at the near post
and the gunners were level in controversial fashion seven minutes after the
break
arsenal william gallas was fortunate not be sent off for crude tackle on
mark davies but referee alan wiley let play continue
the ball eventually fell to fabregas who evaded couple of challenges before
shooting through the legs of bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen
worse was to follow for wanderers with goalscoring centre half vermaelen firing
the gunners in front in the th minute with half volley that went in off the
post
then with five minutes remaining arsenal got the fourth goal they needed to go
top when russia forward arshavin after neat one two with eduardo slammed
shot past jaaskelainen

fighting eases in nigerian city as thousands flee
kano nigeria jan afp
fighting eased on wednesday in the nigerian city of jos after troops deployed to
end four days of christian muslim clashes that left nearly dead and sent
thousands fleeing
authorities relaxed hour curfew in the city after the reduction in
violence which at least one witness said had included mobs going door to door
hacking and shooting those inside
the hour curfew has now been relaxed it will now run from pm
gmt to am gmt ezekiel dalyop plateau state information ministry
director general told afp by phone from jos the state capital
he said the decision was reached due to the relative calm and peace that have
returned to jos flashpoint of religious violence in nigeria whose
million people are divided almost equally between christians and muslims
residents and aid agencies confirmed fighting that erupted on sunday had
subsided even in nearby towns where the violence had spread
the situation has eased fighting has stopped there is no more burning of
houses but large number of people have been displaced said the local red
cross chief awwalu mohammed
at least took refuge in military barracks churches and mosques after
gun and machete wielding gangs rampaged across the city on tuesday
the city is calm this evening no more shootings and no more arsons resident
lawal adamu told afp by phone
residents had earlier said the fighting spread overnight to areas on the fringes
of jos
witness reported that that violent mobs went house to house and buildings and
vehicles were set ablaze in several parts of the city
the christian youths came in large numbers wielding machetes and firing
indiscriminately on the streets said rakya usman who had been living in an
area south of jos called dogon karfe but has since relocated into the city
they broke into homes set them ablaze and attacked residents with their
machetes and guns
un chief ban ki moon expressed alarm over the clashes and appealed for all sides
to use restraint and seek peaceful solutions to religious and other differences
in the country
vice president goodluck jonathan ordered extra troops into the city late tuesday
but for many it came too late
today people are counting their losses many were slaughtered and burnt inside
their homes said civil rights activist shehu sani speaking from jos
police minister ibrahim yakubu lame blamed the clashes on some highly placed
individuals in the society who were exploiting the ignorance and poverty of the
people to cause mayhem in the name of religion and ethnicity
muslim and christian leaders as well as paramedic gave tolls of nearly
dead but there was no official confirmation
about bodies had been taken to the central mosque in jos by late tuesday an
imam there said christian clergyman said he had counted bodies elsewhere
several hundred people have been reported wounded and casualties have filled
hospitals some clinics were reportedly running out of medical supplies
human rights watch hrw said more than people have died in religious or
ethnic clashes in nigeria since the end of military rule in
some religious figures said this week fighting had more to do with social
issues than faith
the truth of the matter is that this violence has little to do with religion
matthew hassan kukah vicar general of catholic archdiocese in the northern
state of kaduna
it failure of government to address national integration it failure of
polity and inability of the political elite to address issues
observers said impunity had also contributed to new outbreaks of violence
this is not the first outbreak of deadly violence in jos but the government
has shockingly failed to hold anyone accountable said hrw researcher corinne
dufka
nigeria senate ordered probe into reports that of the people arrested in
jos five were caught in full military gear and with military firearms
in november hundreds were killed in two days of fighting in jos triggered
by rumour that mainly muslim party had lost local election to christian
dominated party

football arshavin sends arsenal top of the table
london jan afp
arsenal fought back from two goals down to go top of the premier league with
controversial win over bolton at the emirates stadium on wednesday
arsene wenger title chasers were stunned when gary cahill put bolton ahead
before matthew taylor increased the visitors lead with first half penalty
but tomas rosicky strike brought arsenal back into the match and piece of
debatable refereeing from alan wiley allowed the gunners to equalise through
cesc fabregas
wiley waved play on despite william gallas ugly stamp on mark davies and
arsenal ignoring bolton protests took full advantage as fabregas levelled
thomas vermaelen goal completed arsenal revival before andrey arshavin
struck to send the north londoners above previous leaders chelsea on goals
scored
chelsea have game in hand on arsenal but wenger men will fancy their
chances of winning the title race if they continue to play with this kind of
spirit
with pole position up for grabs arsenal needed repeat of the dominant display
that saw them cruise to win at bolton on sunday
but the gunners were caught cold in the seventh minute as woeful defending
allowed bolton to snatch shock lead
french left back gael clichy started the comedy of errors when he miscued
clearance high into the air then vermaelen allowed kevin davies to out jump him
on the edge of the area and the rest of the arsenal defence stood statuesque as
cahill pounced to drive the knock down past manuel almunia
fabregas should have equalised moments later when rosicky pass picked out the
arsenal captain but with only jussi jaaskelainen to beat he shot weakly at the
finn
while arsenal were beginning to carve open bolton back four their own defence
still looked far from impregnable and it needed fine stop from almunia to keep
out taylor low free kick
even the warning of that narrow escape went unheeded and the gunners pressed the
self destruct button again in the th minute
lee chung yong posed no immediate threat when he took possession inside the
penalty area yet denilson betrayed his lack of recent action with poorly
timed lunge that floored the south korean and left wiley with no option but to
award penalty
almunia diving low to his left got both hands to taylor spot kick but
couldn stop it trickling in
wenger must have feared arsenal luck was out when kevin davies accidently
headed fabregas free kick past jaaskelainen only for the ball to hit the
crossbar and bounce to safety
but rosicky gave arsenal lifeline on the stroke of half time taking
fabregas flick in his stride the czech midfielder burst into the penalty area
and from an acute angle smashed fierce strike past jaaskelainen at his near
post
wenger side may have been poor at the back but there was never any question
that they were capable of fashioning an equaliser it came in controversial
circumstances in the nd minute
gallas caught mark davies on the ankle with crude challenge that left the
bolton midfielder writhing in agony
it looked clear foul but wiley played on and despite bolton protests
gallas did just that
the ball was eventually worked into fabregas via arshavin and fortunate
deflection and the spaniard calmly placed his shot through jaaskelainen legs
as fabregas and company celebrated bolton players surrounded wiley to
complain their anger only increased when davies was eventually stretchered off
arsenal were an irresistible force now in the th minute diaby headed
corner down towards vermaelen and the belgian defender had time to pick his spot
and smash arsenal into the lead
bolton spirit had been shattered and arshavin ensured arsenal would take first
place when he took eduardo flick and fired gleefully past jaaskelainen in the
th minute
