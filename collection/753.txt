united nations jan afp
un chief ban ki moon is alarmed by the growing violence in sri lanka including
the reported slaying of political activists ahead of the upcoming presidential
elections his spokesman said wednesday
the secretary general is concerned about the growing violence in the lead up to
the presidential election in sri lanka including the reported killing of
political activists martin nesirky said in statement
ban urged all sri lanka parties and their supporters to show restraint and
refrain from violence to adhere to the electoral laws and rules and to avoid
provocative acts throughout the election period and its aftermath
he stressed that the peaceful conduct of the election is of the highest
importance for long term peace and reconciliation in sri lanka
sri lanka independent election commissioner dayananda dissanayake was quoted
as saying wednesday that he had stopped issuing directives to the police and
other government authorities who disregarded his orders for conducting free
and fair election
dissanayake said he would not issue any more directions to the police because

imf chief calls for marshall plan for devastated haiti
washington jan afp
imf chief dominique strauss kahn on wednesday called for multilateral aid plan
for earthquake devastated haiti like the us marshall plan that rebuilt europe
after world war ii
my belief is that haiti which has been incredibly hit by different things
the food and fuel prices crisis then the hurricane then the earthquake
needs something that is big the managing director of the washington based
international monetary fund said
not only piecemeal approach but something which is much bigger to deal with
the reconstruction of the country some kind of marshall plan that we need
now to implement for haiti he said referring to the us initiative launched in
to rebuild war ravaged western europe
the international community is gearing up for coordinated drive to help
rebuild the poorest country in the western hemisphere even as the primary focus
remains on rescue and relief efforts after the massive magnitude earthquake
on january
officials fear as many as people were killed in the quake that reduced
most of the haitian capital port au prince to rubble
haitian officials said tuesday that people were injured and million
were left homeless
the urgency today is to save the people the urgency in some weeks will be
the reconstruction strauss kahn said
the imf last thursday promised an interest free loan of million dollars in
initial emergency funds to the haitian government to support essential
activities and finance urgent imports
the imf loan has drawn criticism for adding to the debt burden of haiti the
poorest country in the western hemisphere
the most important thing is that the imf is now working with all donors to try
to delete all the haitian debt including our new loan the former french
socialist finance minister said
if we succeed and sure we will succeed even this loan will turn out
to be finally grant because all the debt will have been deleted and that
the very important thing for haiti now
the imf and the world bank classify haiti among heavily indebted poor
countries that are eligible for debt forgiveness the caribbean nation was
granted billion dollars in debt relief last june
the idea of marshall plan like rebuilding of the impoverished country appeared
to be gaining traction
denis brien head of irish telecommunications firm digicel and haiti biggest
foreign investor said recently that he was working alongside former us
president bill clinton on such plan to rebuild haiti
obviously we need foreign direct investment but on wider front we need
marshall plan brien said
canada will host donors conference monday in montreal to discuss haiti
reconstruction efforts and prepare for donors meeting in march
the donors summit to help the former french colony had been proposed by french
president nicolas sarkozy
sarkozy will also deliver the opening address at the th annual meeting of the
world economic forum wef next week in davos switzerland
organizers said the haitian crisis would be major theme at the five day
meeting opening wednesday expect to draw leaders from more than
countries
we want to use davos to solicit commitments of our partners members and
constituents in the form of practical help for relief of the continued pain of
haiti people and particularly for the reconstruction of haiti klaus schwab
wef founder and executive chairman said wednesday
we hope that we can present major common effort to the world community
showing true corporate global citizenship in davos he said
the rebuilding of haiti which already was in dire straits before the horrific
earthquake faces tough challenges not least notoriously weak rule of law
that could result in wasted aid dollars
