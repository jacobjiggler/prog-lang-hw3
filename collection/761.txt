canada fast tracks adoptions of haiti children
ottawa jan afp
canada is fast tracking the adoption of haitian children by canadian families
however the quake devastation in haiti may yet hinder the fostering process
immigration minister jason kenney said wednesday
we are working to reunite families affected by this crisis kenney told
press conference canada has one of the largest haitian diasporas in the world
topping
have directed my official to issue temporary permits which is an
extraordinary measure to allow these children to enter canada as quickly as
possible kenney said
regular processing fees will be waived and the federal government will cover any
immediate health costs
additional immigration staff were also en route to port au prince to help with
immigration applications and new canadian consular office had been set up in
santo domingo capital of the neighboring dominican republic he said
we cannot take haitian children away without approval from local authorities
and these local authorities have indicated to us that they have created an
expedited system committee in essence that will consider and approve
adoption requests for haitian children kenney said
but need to remind all that it is international policy and practice to try
to first find homes for children who have been orphaned in their own country
before placing them in foreign country he said
kenney said his government was also concerned that some haitian canadians may
have been misled by paid immigration consults claiming to be able to speed up
the immigration process for their loved ones
no paid immigration consultant can speed up the process he said sternly

new york jan afp

hrw denounced the conduct of yemeni government forces and of shiite rebels also
known as huthis in the ongoing conflict in north yemen
government forces and huthi fighters both recruited children for combat the
report said huthi fighters carried out summary executions and put civilians in
harm way by firing from populated areas
and government forces reportedly conducted indiscriminate aerial bombardment in
civilian populated areas
fighting between the rebels and the government has occurred sporadically since
the latest round broke out on august when the government launched
operation scorched earth an offensive meant to end the rebellion once and for
all
forces from neighbouring saudi arabia later became involved after the rebels
crossed the border seized two villages and killed border guard
hrw also reproved the saudis saying they blocked refugees access to the
kingdom denied humanitarian access to yemen through its territory and forcibly
returned refugees who had crossed its border
the yemeni government has also blocked humanitarian aid to the north hrw said
in south yemen security forces carried out mass arbitrary arrests surrounding
protests of the peaceful southern movement which calls for the secession of
the region the report said
police fired on peaceful demonstrations on several occasions killing and
wounding protesters it said
the government also practices press censorship hrw said the authorities banned
the distribution of eight of yemen leading independent daily and weekly
newspapers in may
soldiers confiscated copies of al ayyam newspaper on may hrw said
adding that security forces began siege of the newspaper offices two days
later
and on may bystander was killed and another seriously wounded in
shootout between security forces and the paper guards the rights group said
the report was also critical of yemeni counterterrorism efforts in the course
of which security forces arbitrarily detained more than terrorism suspects
without charge
the report praised the yemeni parliament decision to set the minimum age for
marriage at and to allow women to pass their nationality on to their
children
but despite the decision on marriage early marriage remains widespread and
women who marry against parental wishes are sometimes charged with adultery and
imprisoned

plotting velvet coup it said
hrw also said the islamic republic government had staged series of show
trials and jailed journalists and editors for publishing critical views while
imposing strict curbs on the domestic and foreign media
at least two journalists working with foreign outlets were detained

started work at young age those who do heavy work and others who still
intend to retire at and will have to make do with smaller pension
aachboune said people took part in the action to show their dissatisfaction
as parliamentary committee met workers and employer representatives to discuss
the proposed change
police said there were some protesters
the dutch cabinet announced in october last year that the pensionable age would
rise to in and five years later citing deteriorating state finances
and the need to boost labour participation as the netherlands deals with
greying workforce

longer
parliament has yet to approve the plan
the fnv also organised countrywide consumer friendly awareness campaign for
wednesday which included bus tram and metro drivers in the hague and rotterdam
