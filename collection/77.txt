he cannot afford to lose six weeks said western diplomat speaking on
condition that he not be named
karzai brought this on himself and it was widely anticipated that the
parliament would reject the majority of his nominees but it is heartening to
see that he is using the constitution to get over this potential deadlock
ahead of an international conference scheduled to take place in london on
january to deliberate the war torn country future kabul ministries are
being run by junior bureaucrats who have little power and no coherent plan
mp shukria barakzai said the new list of names to replace those who were
tossed out should be presented to parliament within days
think the parliament will get it done rather quickly because the london
conference is due soon she said adding however there are no guarantees that
the new names will be passed
she said the process of presenting and voting on the new nominees would take
about one week
western diplomats including the un special representative kai eide have said
parliament rejection of karzai cabinet choices is an obstacle on
afghanistan road to democratic governance
but they concede it has shown the parliament to be functioning institution
that refused to be cowed by vested interests
the seven ministerial nominees who did win approval included those who had been
approved by karzai supporters in the international community as competent and
clean technocrats

checks on passengers travelling from or via terror linked countries
including yemen
the us and british embassies in sanaa had been shut since sunday for what they
said were security reasons while france on monday announced it too was closing
its mission

invading weed threatens livelihoods in okavango tourist paradise
gaborone jan afp
the unique okavango delta in northern botswana is in danger from an invasive
weed from latin america which is threatening the livelihood of the local people
dependent on fishing and income from tourism
salvinia molesta also known as kariba weed is believed to have found its way
to the world only major inland delta via the rivers that feed into it from
angola
the free floating dark green fern covering the water cuts off oxygen for fish
and blocks the delta channels for the traditional punt like canoes known as
mokoros
local communities and tourism interests are being encouraged to work together to
defeat the menace while scientists think they have found biological means to
keep it under control
it is important for members of the community and tour operators to combine
forces and fight this weed which is threatening the livelihood of most people in
the okavango region
its effects may not be felt at the moment but if it spreads further then the
fishermen will definitely feel the pinch said ketlhatlogile masepelinge
fisheries biologist at the university of botswana
fishing is source of income for most of us in this part of botswana and if
it means working day and night to destroy this weed which is threatening our
fish then let it be so said faosiko wake chairman of the okavango
fishermen association
the delta teeming with wildlife attracts thousands of tourists who stay in
upmarket safari lodges many of them accessible only by air as well as
zoologists and other researchers
tourists love cruising in the delta and we have to make sure that nothing
stands in their way said morongoe ntloedibe chief executive of the
hospitality and tourism association of botswana
salvinia molesta has affected waterways across the world including australia
southeast asia and the pacific as well as parts of africa
it has phenomenal growth rate doubling its dry weight in two and half days
when conditions are right according to australia national commonwealth
scientific and industrial research organisation csiro
salvinia grows quickly to form thick mats covering lakes slow moving rivers
and other waterways the csiro says on its website
these mats severely interfere with the use of water bodies for boating
irrigation flood mitigation and conservation of wildlife once vital waterways
become stagnant ponds supporting only salvinia
fortunately however it has an enemy tiny but deadly in the shape of
cyrtobagous salviniae weevil which australian scientists found feeding on the
plant in its native brazil
according to the csiro the two millimetre long weevils have succeeded in
bringing salvinia infestations under control in at least tropical countries
now it is the turn of botswana where local inhabitants and tour operators alike
are being trained how to breed the weevils which have lifespan of about
days then release them into the delta
this is the best way of getting rid of this weed as the method is friendly to
the environment we could have used chemicals but these are harmful to other
organisms in the water the director of environmental affairs in the ministry
of tourism wildlife and environment steve monna told afp
he said the weed has been present in the delta for some time but in small
quantities however recent unusually high floods and strong winds have caused it
to spread prompting the government to launch the programme to destroy it
it is now up to the communities and tour operators to make sure that they work
hard in breeding the weevils he said
monna said so far the programme was progressing well as both parties had shown
commitment to working towards destroying salvinia

abbas says peace talks conditional on end of settlements
cairo jan afp
palestinian president mahmud abbas said on monday he was open to peace
negotiations with israel but that as agreed with egypt talks could only resume
when jewish settlement activity ends
there is no objection to returning to the negotiating table or holding any
meetings in principle abbas told reporters in the red sea resort of sharm el
sheikh after talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak
we have said and we will continue to say that when there is halt of
settlement activity and recognised terms of reference we are ready to resume
negotiations abbas said
he said egypt agreed with his views contradicting reports in israel maariv
newspaper which said mubarak was to press abbas to accept us peace plan to
restart the talks immediately
president mubarak has stressed that the status of jerusalem be included in
the negotiations that settlement activity must end and there must be clear
terms of reference abbas said
in israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu told members of his likud party
that the time was ripe for resuming the peace process
since the formation of this government have called for restarting
negotiations with the palestinians without preconditions he told the likud
members in parliament on monday
believe the negotiations about entering negotiations have held us up long
enough in recent weeks got the impression that there is something of change
in the air hope there is ripening that will allow the peace process to
start netanyahu said
abbas arrived on sunday and met with egypt intelligence chief omar suleiman
before heading to sharm el sheikh he will later travel to qatar kuwait and
turkey
his visit to egypt comes almost week after netanyahu met mubarak in cairo
about the stalled peace process and as diplomats said washington was drafting
letters of guarantee for the peace talks
meanwhile jordan king abdullah ii also arrived monday in sharm el sheikh where
he held talks with mubarak the egyptian news agency mena said
according to statement from the royal palace in amman the discussions will
centre on efforts to start serious and effective peace talks between the
israelis and palestinians
earlier the israeli paper maariv said washington is pushing plan to restart
israeli palestinian peace talks that foresees reaching final deal in two
years
under the plan the israelis and palestinians will immediately start final
status talks that were suspended during the gaza war year ago and mubarak
would press abbas to agree to the deal maariv said
us president barack obama has repeatedly called on the two sides to resume peace
talks but the palestinians have demanded israel first freeze all settlement
activity and commit to framework for the talks to include that the borders of
future palestinian state encompass all of their land israel occupied in
the palestinians have insisted that mostly arab east jerusalem occupied by
israel in and later annexed in move not recognised by the international
community be the capital of their future state
abbas suspended peace talks with israel after it entered day war with
hamas the islamist rulers of gaza that killed more than palestinians and
left swathes of gaza devastated thirteen israelis were killed
hamas takeover of gaza in which shrank abbas powerbase to the west
bank left deep rift between palestinians that have also hampered peace talks
with israel
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit and suleiman are meanwhile planning
to visit washington on january for talks with officials there
global stocks gain as new year hope rises above crisis
london jan afp
global equities began the new decade in brisk optimistic spirit on monday on
prospects for recovery in contrast to near despair and deep uncertainty
months ago when shares crashed amid the worst downturn since the
markets reopened for business after holiday weekend spent celebrating popping
champagne corks and ushering in the new year and saying goodbye to the old with
relief
financial markets were at risk of systemic breakdown for several months from the
end of into the beginning of but by april so called green shoots of
recovery driven by huge state stimulus programmes were beginning to show
now the big question is whether the momentum of recovery can be sustained as
governments and central banks begin to wind down their costly and eventually
unsustainable spending and rescue programmes and the provision of cheap
money
significant pointer to the answer will come with the trend in the first few
days of trading notably on wall street where the financial crisis of
erupted
on monday the british french and german stock markets rose in early afternoon
deals extending rally from april may in which they all gained more than
percent amid increasing signs that the global downturn was over
london ftse index of leading shares added percent the paris cac
index leapt percent and frankfurt dax index won percent

to expand credit line to troubled japan airlines however hong kong drifted
lower in muted trading
the ftse started the year on the front foot led by the heavyweight banks
and energy firms said analyst nicola poskitt at spread betting firm city
index
we have seen investors coming in this morning in positive moods and firmly
looking for equity markets to continue their moves higher after last year saw
the ftse rally percent
the sentiment is still on the recovery theme and considering the fact that
historically the first trading day of the year usually ends with gains this
rally is no surprise
all three main european markets which had closed early last week for the new
year holiday weekend each gained more than fifth last year amid growing
investor confidence over economic recovery
london and paris each gained more than percent in while frankfurt won
almost percent last year
today sees the markets on the up added capital spreads analyst simon denham
this is not exactly surprising as the first day of virtually every year seems
to be positive as funds look to place at least bit of their cash pot
the energy sector was lifted as oil prices soared beyond dollars per barrel
on expectations of higher heating fuel demand amid freezing cold winter in the
northern hemisphere
meanwhile in asia on monday japan benchmark nikkei index jumped
percent to points which was the best finish for the tokyo stock
exchange since early october
japan airlines jal shares soared by more than percent after the government
on sunday agreed to double state funded loan to the cash strapped carrier to
billion yen billion dollars
new york stocks had slumped at the close of turbulent year on thursday after
positive jobs data sparked concerns that interest rates may rise sooner than
anticipated
but shares settled only slightly below their week highs with strong gains for
the year
wall street reopens later on monday for its first trading session of with
the market dogged by concerns on the timing of any interest rate increase by the
federal reserve amid economy recovery
in early markets had slumped on fears about governments abilities to beat
the worst economic downturn since the
but they were boosted as leading central banks and governments launched radical
measures to boost lending stabilise struggling banks and cut interest rates to
historically low levels
overall many of the factors that have driven equity markets higher in
remain in place loose monetary policy low yields on cash attractive
valuations and cash on the sidelines waiting to be invested said analysts at
brokerage killik amp co
against this background we believe uk equities will continue to move higher in
they added in note published on monday
however we expect another year of uncertainty with little visibility over
number of issues such as the outcome of the general election the timing of an
increase in interest rates and the direction of the dollar
the eurozone japan and the united states all pulled out of recession in
