storms cut philippine rice production in govt
manila jan afp
rice production in the philippines the world biggest importer of the grain
fell by more than percent last year after series of major storms damaged
crops the government said wednesday
tropical storm ketsana and typhoon parma which claimed more than lives in
october and november as they pummelled the main island of luzon were mainly
responsible for the fall in rice output the agriculture ministry said
unmilled rice production was million tonnes last year down percent
from the ministry said in its annual report
the government had already made large tenders in tight global market late last
year to head off possible shortages of rice the staple food for the million
filipinos
the entire crops sector which accounted for percent of total agricultural
output also slid by percent last year due to the bad weather and rising
fertiliser costs the ministry said
however livestock poultry and fisheries managed slight increases to push
agricultural growth up by percent overall
of the philippines key export crops coconut production rose percent while
bananas added percent as key growing areas escaped the worst of the
destructive storms

tennis ruthless rafa on the march
melbourne jan afp
ruthless defending champion rafael nadal was in ominous form as he stormed into
the australian open third round with win over the slovak
republic lukas lacko wednesday
the world number two battled knee problems for much of and there were
question marks over his ability to win here especially after being beaten by
nikolay davydenko in doha in his first tournament of the year
but there were no signs the spaniard was limited as he moved freely on the way
to dominant win in one hour and minutes
it was the first time the pair had played each other and the th ranked lacko
had no answer to the consistency of nadal who hit only two more winners but
made just unforced errors compared to his opponent
having already beaten australian peter luczak in the opening round nadal
imposed himself on the match immediately conceding just eight points in taking
the first five games in quick time and lacko was never able to recover
hampered by tendinitis in both knees nadal relinquished his hold on the french
open last year failing to make another grand slam final after the australian
open
he didn defend his wimbledon title because of injury
nadal will face either german th seed philipp kohlschreiber or american wayne
odesnik in the third round
further into the tournamenet he faces potential quarter final against either
scottish world number five andy murray or the th seeded frenchman gael
monfils
google flap shows challenges of china market
beijing jan afp
beijing college student zhao fang says he admires internet giant google for
standing up to china but admits that won make him any more likely to use the
world top search engine
baidu is better for chinese users zhao said referring to china search
market leader as the year old clicked through jobs website in cybercafe
have never felt as comfortable using google which feels like it is made by
foreign company he said
zhao appraisal came after google announcement last week that it could
abandon google cn and leave china entirely
google cited cyberattacks and censorship but observers say there may be also be
realisation that it remains hard to deliver on the promise of china fabled
market of billion consumers
if google was making billions and billions of dollars think this would be
different story said jeremy goldkorn editor of danwei org website focussed
on china media industry that is itself blocked in the country
while many ventures have prospered during china three decade opening to the
world that period is also littered with examples of foreign companies whose
plans went awry
the reasons range from cultural and linguistic factors to rules seen as
stacking the deck in favour of domestic competitors to the misguided faith of
some firms that success elsewhere will translate into big sales in china
but no sectors are perhaps as hard to crack as the internet and media which are
among the most heavily regulated due to the communist government strict
controls on the flow of information
it very very tough it one of the most hostile environments in the world
for foreign media and internet companies goldkorn said
there is not one foreign internet company that has made success of it here
not single one
two years after entering china google competitor yahoo signed deal in
to buy percent of alibaba com while handing over the running of its local
operations to the chinese commerce giant
tensions in the relationship erupted on sunday when alibaba condemned the
support offered by yahoo to google as reckless
edward yu head of internet research firm analysys international said his
company surveys showed many web users preferred baidu in searches for local
content
there are definitely google lovers out there but if you are looking for local
information baidu is seen as better choice he said
baidu is seen as catering better to china legions of youthful online users
with its focus on entertainment content such as music downloads rather than news
or other information
and it has far more of the online forums that provide one of china few avenues
for public expression analysts say
baidu has also spent lavishly on advertising to perpetuate its status as the
more chinese search engine said yu
while baidu basks in high profile three of the biggest names on the global
internet google owned youtube micro blogging site twitter and social
networking site facebook are all blocked in china
google acquiesced to china censors to enter the country in but has
snared only about percent of the search engine market according to
independent data baidu has about percent
google announcement made no mention of its business prospects in china
but it has said previously that china despite having the world largest
number of online users at million remains an insignificant portion of
its global revenues
google has faced criticism for not doing enough to counter perceptions among
some chinese users that it is an alien interloper
in the past google didn like to spend money on ads here as if they were
powerful enough and big enough and didn need to but it different story in
china said yu at analysys international
even google name poses problems for zhao fang the job hunting student
in the chinese pronunciation the name comes out as gu ge which can translate
into the somewhat obscure valley song or cereal song
chinese person can say baidu fine but not google this is symbolic
think zhao said stumbling over the name despite his perfect english
tennis clijsters survives tough tamarine test
melbourne jan afp
kim clijsters plans to move up gear after being given thorough examination
by gritty veteran tamarine tanasugarn at the australian open on wednesday
clijsters went into the match as the overwhelming favourite against the year
old thai but was made to work hard for over minutes on the rod laver arena
before grinding out win
the world number who won the brisbane international at the start of the
year said she was pleased win despite not playing her best
you know feel like good enough on the day to beat my opponents she
said
it not with my best tennis yet but hopefully can save that when it
really necessary
tammy was very tricky very hard to read her game as well tricky serve
there not much on it but she doesn give you anything where you can just
step in and hit lot of winners or really go for lot
so just had to kind of be patient wait for the right shot to go for it
the year old said she had always been able to time her run at tournaments
knowing when she needed to take her game to another level
even last week in brisbane was good example clijsters said
you know won my matches not always convincingly but good enough
but when had to play well against justine henin in the final was able to
really raise my level
that something that obviously after having been off for long time it takes
time to get that to have that routine of knowing how to react in those kind of
situations
was happy was able to do that against justine and at the us open last
year as well so hopefully can keep rising like that
tamarine has the distinction of being the most experienced grand slam campaigner
at the australian open competing this year in her st tournament three more
than nearest challenger venus williams
she made her grand slam debut at the australian open and used all her
experience to keep pace with clijsters
however the belgian was able to convert the points that mattered in both sets
to ease her way to narrow win
nobody expected close match when clijsters broke tamarine first service game
and opened lead
but the thai refused to give in and she gradually worked her way back into the
match holding her next two service games then breaking clijsters to get back to
clijsters struck right back however breaking tamarine then holding her own
serve to claim the first set in minutes
the thai was playing with enormous confidence and she broke clijsters early in
the second set to jump to lead
but she was unable to sustain the pressure and the reigning us open champion
fought back to claim her third win over tamarine but her first since
tamarine was kicking herself afterwards saying she got herself into good
positions by changing tactics but couldn find the killer touch
nevertheless she said she enjoyed herself and loved playing on rod laver arena
right now actually enjoying my tennis more than before she said
because before was stressed out and had to do well but now just
enjoying my tennis if it goes well it goes well if not ll just enjoy
playing

grisly massacre footage shown at philippine trial
manila jan afp
philippine politician accused of massacring people displayed no emotion
wednesday as grisly footage was shown in court of the victims mangled and
bloodied bodies being pulled from mass graves
the video clips were part of evidence introduced by prosecutors against andal
ampatuan jnr who is charged with murder over the election related killings in
the southern province of maguindanao in november last year
filmed by local government employee who accompanied police as they retrieved
the victims from the mass graves in the two days after the murders the video
showed bloodied bodies some of which were already decomposing
as the footage was shown sister of one of the female victims broke down and
had to be helped out of the courtroom
male lawyer representing the victims also rushed out of the silent courtroom
covering his mouth as he headed for the bathroom to vomit
however ampatuan jnr who has pleaded not guilty had no visible reaction to the
footage at one point applying liniment to his neck as he stifled yawn
he looked bored it was like the most ordinary thing to watch lilian de lima
head of the government commission on human rights who was in the courtroom
told reporters
prosecutors allege ampatuan jnr and about of his gunmen abducted and shot
dead the victims to stop rival esmael mangudadatu from running against him
for the post of maguindanao governor in may elections
mangudadatu wife and pregnant sister as well as at least journalists
travelling with them were among the killed mangudadatu relatives had been
on their way to an election office to register his candidacy
police have said ampatuan jnr father and namesake the patriarch of the clan
who was then governor of maguindanao should also be charged over the killings
ampatuan snr and several other clan members were arrested after martial law was
briefly imposed in maguindanao and charged with rebellion
however no date for his rebellion trial has been set and prosecutors have yet
to lay murder charges against him
before the killings the ampatuans were close political allies of president
gloria arroyo who armed and used them to help contain muslim separatist rebels
in the southern philippines

best tennis yet but hopefully can save that when it really necessary
clijsters could meet fellow comeback queen justine henin in the quarter finals
although henin has major hurdle to clear in fifth seed elena dementieva on rod
laver arena later wednesday
unlike the high profile clijsters and henin russian third seed kuznetsova is
flying under the radar and looked impressive in her defeat of
countrywoman anastasia pavlyuchenkova
the french open champion whose best effort here has been the quarter finals
said she had prepared well in the off season and was ready to make an impact
think ve done good pre season ve worked hard and ve enjoyed it she
said

imf chief warns against stall in banking reform
hong kong jan afp
the head of the international monetary fund on wednesday said world leaders
must not abandon financial sector reforms designed to prevent repeat of the
credit crisis that devastated economies
imf managing director dominique strauss kahn said it was crucial to usher in key
changes including better regulation and oversight of the banking sector
we need reform and we need political will he told the asian financial forum
in hong kong
there is still lot to do my concern is that in six to months everybody
will be back to business as usual and will have forgotten the lessons of the
financial crisis
global economies were sent into tailspin in late when credit dried up due
largely to the knock on effect of the collapse of the sub prime or high
risk mortgage sector in the us
strauss kahn reasserted his dismissal of so called double dip recession for
the global economy but said the pace of recovery has been sluggish and uneven
with asia bouncing back faster than the rest of the world
he reiterated his call for china to boost the value of its currency the yuan
as critics accuse beijing of keeping the unit artificially low to boost exports
strauss kahn also played down fears about an asset bubble forming in china and
the wider region growing worry as regional property prices surge
but asian countries should usher in temporary capital controls as response to
the massive amount of foreign money flowing into their economies he added
the region must also look at boosting domestic demand to cut its reliance on
foreign consumers especially in the hard hit united states strauss kahn said
liu mingkang chairman of the china banking regulatory commission said chinese
policy makers are pushing hard to boost domestic consumption especially in
rural areas
the commission is also moving to control the explosive pace of lending among
china banks liu said
foreign predators circle crippled japan airlines
tokyo jan afp
as bankrupt japan airlines prepares to shed fat in bid to stay airborne
analysts say foreign rivals are gearing up for feeding frenzy over the
crippled carrier routes and landing slots
the once venerable flag carrier market value is now considerably less than one
of its jumbo jets but its slots to take off and land in tokyo are coveted by
foreign rivals
fierce battle is already underway between american airlines and delta air
lines which are both offering financial assistance to jal in return for
cooperation in areas such as joint flight operations through code sharing
delta the world largest carrier appears to be gaining the upper hand with an
invitation for jal to join the skyteam airline network which currently has no
japanese partner
on the table is package worth billion dollars million dollar
equity injection revenue guarantee worth million dollars and million
dollars in asset backed funding
seeking to trump that american airlines and its partners have offered the
japanese carrier an investment of billion dollars if it stays in the
oneworld alliance which also groups british airways and qantas
it feeding frenzy over the market and slots they would like to acquire to
operate codeshare flights on behalf of jal said andrew miller former chief
operating officer at air new zealand
the alliances are trying to acquire some benefit from working closely with jal
because the restructuring is going to take two to three years and during that
time there ll be some picking from the carcass of the bone
efforts to forge cross pacific partnerships were given added impetus last month
when tokyo and washington struck an open skies deal making it easier for
japanese and us carriers to enter new code sharing alliances
if jal joins skyteam it is highly likely that jal flights to america will be
replaced by delta said yasuhiro matsumoto credit analyst at shinsei
securities
but it would take time for jal and delta to get approval from us authorities for
joint operations he added
jal bankruptcy filing is just the first step in what is likely to be long
and complex overhaul by the debt ridden carrier which aims to slash more than
jobs and axe unprofitable routes to staunch massive losses
jal which reassured passengers it would continue to operate flights during its
bankruptcy made no announcement regarding its talks with american airlines and
delta air lines when it unveiled its turnaround plan tuesday
but just hours after it filed for bankruptcy both us carriers issued statements
saying they stood ready to support the once iconic airline
as jal becomes slimmer delta would provide many flights said yoshihisa akai
head of research at japan aviation management research an advisory firm
us giants are not the only ones waiting in the wings
japanese discount airline skymark has long been seeking to expand in country
dominated by just two carriers jal and all nippon airways and which has
airfares much higher than those in europe or the united states
