conan brien leaves nbc in million dollar deal reports
los angeles jan afp
conan brien will leave nbc in million dollar deal it was reported
thursday ending an ugly public feud surrounding the fate of us television
long running the tonight show
brien acrimonious departure clears the way for predecessor jay leno to
return at the helm of the late night chat show he had hosted for years until
he stepped down seven months ago
nbc television will hope the deal which will see brien pocket around
million dollars with the balance going to his staff draws line under what
has been public relations disaster for the network
the bitter wrangling exploded into public earlier this month when reports
circulated that brien show was to be given new am scheduling slot to
accommodate new half hour program hosted by leno
it followed nbc decision to cancel leno prime time show starting at pm
after only four months following poor ratings
however brien refused to accept the change quietly accusing nbc in public
letter of attempting to destroy the tonight show and vowing to quit his long
term deal if the change went ahead
the feuding has become nightly staple of brien opening tonight show
monologues where he has repeatedly ridiculed his nbc paymasters
on tuesday show he delighted audience members by informing them he was just
three days away from the biggest drinking binge in history
spent the afternoon at universal studios amusement park enjoying their
brand new ride the tunnel of litigation brien said in reference to
negotiations for his departure
noting reports that he was legally prohibited from criticizing nbc in public
brien then added nobody said anything about speaking in spanish
he then broke into spanish to tell the audience nbc is run by brainless sons
of goats who eat money and crap trouble
brien manager gavin polone told the wall street journal on thursday his
client was pleased with the deal
in the end conan was appreciative of the steps nbc made to take care of his
staff and crew and decided to supplement the severance they were getting out of
his own pocket polone said
now he just wants to get back on the air as quickly as possible
brien is reported to be in talks of returning to the air with the fox network

plea deal

yemen stops giving entry visas at airports over qaeda threat
sanaa jan afp
yemen stopped granting entry visas on arrival at airports on thursday to prevent
militants from entering the country widening its dragnet against an al qaeda
cell believed behind spate of global attacks
the measure comes amid military crackdown on al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
aqap which is entrenched in mountain redoubts east of the capital and claimed
responsibility for the botched christmas day bid to down us airliner
approaching detroit
yemen has stopped granting visas at the airport to halt terrorist
infiltration state news agency saba announced
military official said that in light of this decision granting visas to
foreigners will take place only through the embassies of yemen and after
consulting security authorities to verify the identities of travellers
this is to prevent the infiltration of any suspected terrorist elements he
was quoted by the defence ministry newspaper september as saying
six yemeni airports handle international flights and until now only travellers
from few countries had to obtain visas before flying
earlier this week the us senate foreign relations committee released report
warning that aqap might be training as many as three dozen americans who
converted to islam in prison
these people travelled to yemen upon their release ostensibly to study arabic
but possibly for al qaeda training the report said
under previous regulations these people would have been allowed to enter the
country without being vetted beforehand
us officials are on heightened alert because of the potential threat from
extremists carrying american passports and the related challenges involved in
detecting and stopping homegrown operatives the report added
sanaa has been under intense international pressure to eradicate aqap which has
claimed it was behind attacks against saudi korean yemeni and us targets
since it was founded year ago
in late december yemen launched new military campaign against the group
claiming to have killed or arrested dozens of jihadists and their leaders
as recently as wednesday yemeni warplanes bombed site that was believed to be
hideout for prominent al qaeda members in maarib province
the general committee of president ali abdullah saleh general people
congress praised strikes against al qaeda on thursday saying they prevented
terrorist elements from carrying out operations aimed at the security of the
state and its citizens saba reported
the committee also emphasized the importance of security agencies continuing to
pursue terrorists and outlaws it added
sanaa official on thursday applauded citizens for their help in the fight
against the extremists saying they had provided useful information that has
strengthened the government efforts in pursuing al qaeda members
also on thursday an official said one soldier was killed and three were wounded
in maarib province by unknown gunmen who might belong to al qaeda
the most high profile yemeni american in the country is fugitive radical imam
anwar al awlaqi native of new mexico who is now in hiding presumably in part
of eastern yemen where his family tribe holds sway
white house aide has directly accused awlaqi of links with major nidal hasan
the man suspected of shooting dead people at texas military base in
november
us homeland security and counterterrorism adviser john brennan has also said
awlaqi might have had contact with the man who allegedly attempted to blow up
the us airliner on december umar farouk abdulmutallab
officials are also worried about non yemeni americans blonde haired
blue eyed types who travelled to yemen converted to islam became
fundamentalists married yemeni women and fit the profile of americans that al
qaeda has sought to recruit
aqap meanwhile has issued statement celebrating the first anniversary of its
founding according to the us based site intelligence group which monitors
jihadist websites
the tuesday statement claimed the botched strike on the detroit bound airliner
and failed attempt to assassinate saudi arabia deputy interior minister
it claimed aqap was an inspiration to muslims the world over and nightmare
from which the zionist crusaders and the arab apostates cannot seem to awaken
