saying they were winding down efforts to find people trapped in the wreckage and
had turned their focus to helping homeless survivors
thousands of people meanwhile braved new aftershocks to queue for the first
major food handouts in central port au prince since the magnitude quake as
others scrambled for place on free buses out of the squalid city
un spokesman elisabeth byrs said early friday that some exhausted international
rescue teams were heading home and that others were concentrating more and more
on humanitarian aid for those who need it

queuing calmly for hours around the destroyed presidential palace as brazilian
un peacekeepers handed out tonnes of ration packs and litres of water
elsewhere the un world food program said it staged massive aid distributions at
football stadium and in the downtown delmas district designed to feed
people
two brief but relatively strong aftershocks rocked the city as the handouts took
place sending some residents running in panic
un relief spokesman vincenzo pugliese said the situation in the devastated
capital was improving with security largely calm supermarkets set to reopen
next week and nearly third of all gas stations open
but in downtown port au prince residents burned at least six bodies because no
one had collected them since the disaster three charred skeletons could be seen
on pile of garbage and three others were in nearby ruins an afp reporter
said
tens of thousands of seriously injured haitians also remain in primitive
conditions in makeshift field hospitals

of the filthy conditions in port au prince to hastily set up villages in the
south and north of the country designed to hold people each

to appear espinoza said ve made it clear he needs to surrender motion
is denied
polanski lawyers told reporters immediately after the hearing they would
appeal the judge decision
polanski is under house arrest in switzerland where he has been held since
his detention in september on an arrest warrant
the oscar winning film maker fled the united states years ago before being
sentenced on charges of having unlawful sex with year old girl
prosecutors last week filed motion opposing any move to sentence polanski in
absentia asserting it would set dangerous precedent
the defendant is fugitive deputy district attorney david walgren wrote in
court papers the defendant should not indeed must not be allowed to dictate
to this court or any other court under what terms these proceedings should
proceed mr polanski must surrender
in an exchange with espinoza on friday walgren was cautioned against referring
to polanski as child rapist
this fugitive this criminal this convicted felon this child rapist must
surrender to the court walgren said before being cut off by the judge

only to unlawful sex and not the more serious charge of rape rather not
inflame espinoza said
the victim in the case samantha geimer had supported polanski in absentia
request
california appeals court in december rejected bid by the director legal
team to have the case dismissed on the grounds of judicial misconduct during the
initial proceedings
polanski lawyer chad hummel referred to the allegations of misconduct during
friday hearing saying his client does not trust this system
polanski is alleged to have given his victim champagne and drugs during
photo shoot at the hollywood hills home of actor friend jack nicholson before
having sex with her despite her protests
the director was initially charged with six felony counts including rape and
sodomy the charge was later reduced to unlawful sexual intercourse after plea
deal agreed in part to spare his victim the ordeal of trial
polanski later served days at secure unit undergoing psychiatric evaluation
but fled the united states on the eve of his sentencing in amid fears that
the trial judge planned to go back on previously agreed plea deal
polanski flight from justice came after string of hit films including
rosemary baby and chinatown

port au prince jan afp
the gardens of haitian prime minister jean max bellerive grand official

earthquake that devastated the capital
am proud that the prime minister has opened the gates of his garden even if
feel little sad said leon frantz young doctor who lost his house in the
january disaster but goes to the residence every day to help distribute
medicine
looking like relic of the caribbean nation colonial past the white villa
with red roof tiles sits on the top of little hill with the gardens stretched
out beneath
but while the grounds used to be an oasis of calm in chaotic port au prince
they are now buried beneath sea of white and blue plastic sheets laid out by
people left homeless in the quake
the palace itself is closed because of the risk of landslides inside
valuable set of historic dishes has been smashed pictures have fallen off the
walls and the walls have cracked as if made of clay
the prime minister cabinet chief juve herve day sat on the patio and
prepared to spend another night in his car
before go to sleep like to take walk to listen to their complaints said
day pointing out the crowds of people who ferry water through the gardens and
cook beneath their makeshift shelters

tense but day insisted it was not
there is security perimeter and they respect it he said the day the
earthquake happened we opened these spaces up to the public
haiti official buildings have all found new uses since the quake
the imposing presidential palace in the city center was largely destroyed its
white cupola half toppled from its perch and its gardens have been used as
landing pad for helicopters
the haitian cabinet is meeting in police station at the airport but it is
only the prime minister office that is actually housing refugees
in the gardens sat melie laventin who has five children the youngest just
six months old
after the quake destroyed their home near the palace she came here immediately
with her husband not knowing what to expect
she had never previously set foot in the prime minister office and would
gladly never do so again
just want them to get us out of here want to get out of port au prince
she said
her husband is unemployed and has no way to pay for tickets out of the capital
for the family apparently unaware of government program offering free buses
to new tent camps in other parts of the country
we don know where to go she added

washington jan afp
us president barack obama is troubled by cyberattacks on internet titan google
and wants answers from china the white house said friday
the state department said meanwhile that us and chinese diplomats have held
several meetings to discuss the attacks which google said targeted the email
accounts of chinese human rights activists and more talks were expected
we are having high level meetings and we will continue to have meetings and we
will continue to press this issue aggressively state department spokesman
philip crowley said we will continue to seek an explanation from china
obama is also looking to beijing to shed some light on the cyberattacks which
have prompted google to say it will stop censoring web search results in china
move that may force it to leave the country entirely
as the president has said he continues to be troubled by the cybersecurity
breach that google attributes to china white house deputy spokesman bill
burton said as secretary hillary clinton said yesterday all we are looking
for from china are some answers
clinton on thursday urged beijing to conduct thorough investigation into the
cyberattacks on google and other us firms and criticized china and other nations
for censoring the web and restricting the free flow of information
the secretary of state comments in wide ranging speech on internet freedom
drew the strongest reaction to date from china since the google dispute erupted
last week
we firmly oppose such words and deeds which go against the facts and are
harmful to china us relations foreign ministry spokesman ma zhaoxu said we
urge the united states to respect facts and stop using the so called internet
freedom issue to criticize china unreasonably
ma urged the united states not to let the google row upset relations which are
already dogged by range of disputes over trade and currency issues us arms
sales to taiwan and climate change
ma said china hoped both sides would respect each other core interests and
major concerns properly handle differences and sensitive issues to maintain the
healthy and steady development of sino us relations
state department spokesman crowley said the united states had taken note of
the chinese foreign ministry statement but had no further comment
he said the latest us china meeting had been between kurt campbell assistant
secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs and the chinese
ambassador here zhou wenzhong
he said clinton speech google and the broader aspects of our relationship
were discussed
we have broad relationship with china crowley said we think that it is
far more stable than it has been in some time that said we have range of
issues where we have you know disagreements
he also said that washington had not yet made formal request to beijing
known as demarche asking for an explanation for the cyberattacks on google
senior state department official told reporters that while the united states
and china have differences on the issue of internet freedom clinton speech
was not directed at china individually
asked about china public posture and the diplomatic talks the official said
there are things that china does for public consumption and that may or may not
reflect the conversations that we have in private
the chinese understood the context of the secretary speech and that it wasn
specifically directed at them said the official who spoke to reporters on the
condition of anonymity
google has not yet stopped censoring search results on google cn but google
chief executive eric schmidt said thursday it will happen soon
we continue to follow their laws we continue to offer censored results but in
reasonably short time from now we will be making some changes there schmidt
said
china is believed to employ thousands of people in vast system of internet
censorship dubbed the great firewall of china which polices what the world
largest online population can see and do on the web
beijing regularly invokes the need to stamp out pornography as key reason for
the controls but critics contend its primary purpose is to quell political
dissent or content seen as threatening to communist party rule

britain bans export of unsuitable bomb detector
london jan afp
britain said friday it would ban the export of machine marketed as bomb
detector to iraq and afghanistan amid claims that it does not work
the ade marketed by british based company called atsc and reportedly
bought in large numbers by the iraqi military will be banned for export from
next week after bbc investigation challenged its effectiveness
tests have shown that the technology used in the ade and similar devices is
not suitable for bomb detection the department for business innovation and
skills said
it added as soon as it was brought to the attention of the export control
organisation and business secretary lord peter mandelson we acted urgently
to put in place export restrictions which will come into force next week
while atsc does not need an export licence because the ade is not officially
military technology the department said it is clearly of concern that it is
being used as bomb detection equipment
the ban will be limited to iraq and afghanistan the department said because
our legal power to control these goods is based on the risk that they could
cause harm to uk and other friendly forces
it added the british embassy baghdad has raised our concerns about the ade
with the iraqi authorities
we have offered co operation with any investigation they may wish to make into
the how the device came to be bought for their military as bomb detection
