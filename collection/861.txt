british holocaust denier bishop appears in video online
paris jan afp
renegade british catholic bishop summoned to trial for denying the holocaust
has appeared in an online video voicing anti israeli views and acknowledging
that he broke german law on racial hatred
in the video on the french site dailymotion richard williamson responds to
questions in french saying lots of people think that israel is legitimate
state that does not necessarily mean it is one
williamson was last month summoned to face trial on charges of inciting racial
hatred for saying in an interview in germany that not one jew was killed in
gas chambers by the nazis
the german court said he denied the charges against him and refused to pay the
euro dollar fine that would enable him to avoid trial he has
kept low profile since the controversial interview in january
in the dailymotion video posted on thursday he appeared indoors sitting next to
christmas tree talking to pierre panet french anti zionist political
activist
he acknowledged that he had called into question the gassing of six million
jews and that to do so was crime according to german law
williamson belongs to swiss based catholic fraternity which appointed him
bishop without the pope blessing after it broke away from rome over reforms
introduced by vatican ii in
williamson comments last year sparked outrage in germany where it is illegal
to deny the holocaust
german chancellor angela merkel called on pope benedict xvi to clarify
unambiguously that there can be no denial that the nazis killed six million
jews
pope benedict xvi also drew strong criticism for cancelling the excommunication
of williamson and three other bishops of the ultra conservative saint pius
society

nairobi jan afp
kenya will be gunning for the top spot in the icc intercontinental cup when they
take on leaders scotland in their top of the table clash in nairobi next week
coach eldine baptiste said on friday
the former west indies all rounder believes the kenyan team had shown big
improvement to their game since their five wicket loss to zimbabwe xi last
october and were in strong contention to challenge for their first title in the
tournament
since taking over in september baptiste had made several changes to the squad
by bringing in seven young players who will feature in both the four day match
and the five twenty warm up matches against scotland and uganda
the players know they have to work hard to be number one there is no room for
second place he told afp the area we have had to work big time is the
performances of the players
we lost the match to zimbabwe because of missed catches and losing easy wickets
but we have corrected our mistakes added baptiste
former skipper steve tikolo who holds the highest number of runs in the
tournament with has returned from zimbabwe where he plays franchise cricket
for the southern rocks to bolster the side
scotland heads the standings with points after two matches while kenya which
has played three games have points
sheriff obama rattles europe banks analysts
london jan afp
tough words and strong action by us president barack obama to crimp us banks
provoked outspoken controversy in europe on friday where banking shares fell
sharply
stock markets generally have recoiled at the tone of obama remarks and amid
uncertainty about the implications
some financial sector comment said that the huge london financial market would
and should copy his proposals to cut down the plutocracy of banking tighten
rules on trading by banks and to separate their high risk activities
but others argued that obama was shooting from the hip like wild west
sheriff that his measures were driven by political opportunism missed the
causes of the crisis could damage us financial markets and global investment
president obama announcement means the uk government will have to act to
break up the banks here in britain commented professor stefano harney of the
school of business management at queen mary university london
not to follow his lead would be to condemn the city of london to become the
largest offshore banking colony in the world with all the corruption and
instability that would come with that he said
analysts at cm cic bank in paris commented the proposals will cause
difficulties in valuing banks and will slow down reorganisation of the sector
throughout regulatory issues would continue to poison the sector they
said
they also questioned whether proposals being put forward by politicians
wanting to change everything in the heat of the moment for sector in the
middle of an economic crisis were appropriate
at brokers aurel analyst christian parisot said the sector could experience
strong volatility because of the impossibility for analysts of working out the
fundamental value of banks
in london the british bankers association said that we will be studying the
proposals in detail to see where the us and international proposals align with
what is already being discussed in terms of reforms in britain
professor harney said that the only way to ensure that big banks created jobs
and made loans was if they are broken up and forced to make money from
investment not speculation commenting that massive bonuses by us bank goldman
sachs is an example of the arrogance that can lead from democracy to
plutocracy
but at currency group ecu economist kit juckes commented in blog maybe in
the american wild west of the cinema the moral of the tale would have been
don provoke the sheriff
he said sheriff obama wanted the bankers to eat humble pie wear sackcloth and
ashes and show some humility but when he didn get that response he clearly
got riled and has come out looking for fight modern tale sheriff goes on
shooting rampage
juckes argued that so called proprietary trading targeted by obama was not the
cause of the crisis and was small part of bank revenues
policy makers set interest rates far too low encouraging binge borrowing
regulators were asleep at the wheel bankers failed to see the dangers inherent
in what they were doing and borrowers simply borrowed too much he argued
he warned that obama proposals would would reduce the capacity of banks to
lend and would reduce their profitability this would undermine the value of
banking shares and meant that the upward trend in equity indices has ground to
halt at least for now
interest rates would stay low for longer and probably send asset prices
higher
the senior strategist at bcg partners in london howard wheeldon argued that
the obama plan was politically very adept but that at stroke obama had
chosen to write off any resumed basis of normality in the us banking system
this opened period of political acrimony that is as undesirable as it could
be potentially damaging to the us
at citibank in london analyst michael hart said that the announcement had
raised aversion to risk and that in the medium term the proposals were likely
to lead to massive reduction in financial investment around the world and
consequent capital repatriation which could eventually support the dollar
some us banking institutions might hand back their banking licences and some
might divest their risky operations thereby splintering the industry
fund manager tim roberts at cavendish asset management said the announcement
goes far beyond what the markets can stomach from the volatile banking sector
and the creeping political tenor of financial debate attacking the heart and
soul of wall street is not the answer
the causes of the crisis were long standing and arose from easy access to
capital resulting in over leveraging he argued referring to heavy borrowing on
the basis of strongly valued assets the answer he argued was to focus on
restricting such gearing and this had been largely done by tightening rules on
capital
the obama proposals would simply damage long term economic prospects for
everyone

football mancini urges tevez to draw line under neville spat
manchester jan afp
manchester city boss roberto mancini has ordered carlos tevez to draw line
under his spat with gary neville after the argentina striker branded his former
team mate boot licker and moron
tevez colourful outburst came after he and neville clashed during city
win over manchester united on tuesday and has set the scene for another
explosive meeting between the clubs in next week second leg of their league
cup semi final
these things can sometimes happen after match mancini said friday the
players are tired and sometimes they do not think what they are saying
it is important that this matter is finished now as we need to focus on our
next game
sir alex ferguson declined to get embroiled in dispute that was triggered by
neville writing in newspaper column that united manager was right to sell
tevez to city last year rather than pay the million pounds it would have cost
to sign him permanently
not interested ferguson told reporters he tevez is not our player any
more ve nothing to say about it at all players argue with each other and
have go at each other time and time again it not an issue for us
ferguson refused to condemn neville united club captain for raising his
middle finger to tevez as the argentina striker jubilantly celebrated the first
of his two goals on tuesday evening
asked whether he was disappointed in neville conduct ferguson replied no
what conduct didn see that at all
tevez admitted on wednesday that he had been hurt by neville comments and
through his representatives issued fairly measured statement accusing the
defender of showing uncharacteristic disrespect to former colleague
but in radio interview with espn argentina conducted in spanish the
forward tone was far more scathing
my celebration was directed at gary neville he confirmed he acted like
complete sock sucker boot licker when he said wasn worth million just
to suck up to the manager
don know what the hell that idiot is talking about me for never said
anything about him
tevez who has struggled to learn even basic english in his four years in
england added that he had been taken aback when his team mates alerted him to
press coverage of neville opinions originally expressed in column for the
times of malta
my team mates were asking what thought tevez recalled and wondered to
myself what the tarado translation cretin or moron talking about me for
when never said anything about him
tevez was hugely popular with the united fans during his two years on loan at
the club but having opted to cross swords with neville he is guaranteed
hostile reception at old trafford next week although that will not concern him
too much if he can help city reach wembley at the expense of his former
employers
the forward will sit out city fa cup match against scunthorpe on sunday to
ensure he is as fresh as possible for the trip to old trafford mancini
