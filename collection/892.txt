survivor to be rescued said lieutenant colonel christophe renou from
french firefighting team
what happened is extraordinary he resisted for days which is
particularly incredible french ambassador didier le bret said at the scene
as the street was being cleared youths spray painted graffiti on nearby wall
saying we don need the france help only the usa in usa we trust
exantus family had informed greek rescue workers that they heard his voice and
they passed on the information to the united nations who contacted french and
us rescue teams
he told the teams that five other people were alive with him but the
firefighters said they detected no other signs of life although they added that
there could still be survivors under rubble nearby
the rescue effort was glimmer of hope after magnitude quake on january
which killed more than people and left hundreds of thousands
homeless
several conditions enabled the man to survive for so long under the rubble
renou said
he was in quite large space where he could move bit inside and he found
little bit of water to help him keep going
the building was also made of wood in the shade of two larger concrete ones he
added offering some protection from the tropical heat
despite recent rescue successes the united nations in geneva said the haitian
government had declared the search and rescue phase over at pm gmt
on friday
france however sent new rescue team in two days ago to allow us at least
until mid february to keep the capacity for rescue and recovery renou said
before the latest rescue un relief spokesman in haiti vincenzo pugliese
said some foreign search and rescue teams were still in the capital days
after the earthquake and so far they have saved people

football riise late show sinks juve leaves ferrara on brink
rome jan afp
norway left back john arne riise popped up in injury time to head home the
winner as as roma condemned man juventus to an eighth defeat in matches
with success in turin on saturday
the defeat will surely leave juve coach ciro ferrara on the brink as his mis
firing team slumped to sixth defeat in eight serie clashes and to make
matters worse italy goalkeeper gianluigi buffon was dismissed
the win moved in form roma to within two points of second placed ac milan who
play inter milan on sunday
they now have eight wins and three draws in their last league matches but
club captain francesco totti doesn want to get carried away
we re going through great period in terms of results we stood up to juve
he said
where do we want to get to right now we re not thinking about anyone else than
ourselves
ferrara sprung surprise in his line up leaving out former world player of the
year fabio cannavaro in favour of nicola legrottaglie possibly in order to
combat the aerial threat posed by roma forward luca toni
but both coaches plans were thrown out the window couple of minutes in as
toni pulled up with calf injury and was replaced by totti making his comeback
from injury
the switch seemed to suck any attacking threat out of roma and juve dominated
the first minutes
bosnia veteran hasan salihamidzic fired well over from distance on nine minutes
before brazilian forward amauri rose highest in crowded box to meet zdenek
grygera right wing cross heading wide under pressure from nicolas burdisso
juve best chances were coming from the flanks and amauri won another header on
minutes this time from fabio grosso left wing cross but again he directed
it wide
next it was devillish free kick from diego that caused problem in the roma
defence but alessandro del piero couldn get enough contact to direct his
header on target
juve needed stroke of luck or moment of genius to break the deadlock and
they got both six minutes after the restart
diego low ball into the box spun up off juan foot del piero was perfectly
placed for the dropping ball and his left foot volley from tight angle low
into the far corner was pure vintage
but if juve had needed something special to find the net roma needed helping
hand and they got it courtesy of grosso and the referee
rodrigo taddei ran onto through ball into the box and tried to turn inside
grosso but the full back left out an arm and although contact was minimal
taddei flopped to the ground and the referee pointed to the spot with totti
slotting home the penalty
juve resorted to the tactic that served them well in the first period and
substitute antonio candreva lofted high ball into the box but amauri header
was straight at goalkeeper julio sergio
the hosts were almost made to pay as taddei released the breaking riise with
juve caught upfield but buffon sacrificed himself charging out of his area and
bringing down the marauding norwegian full back to prevent him going through on
goal
buffon barely even waited for the red card before walking off the field
but then riise it was who charged forward deep into injury time to meet david
pizarro cross at the back post and heap misery on juve
earlier catania cruised to crucial victory at home to parma to improve
their chances of beating the drop leaving them th but just one point from
