madrid jan afp

pressure to respond with home win over malaga on sunday or risk barcelona
running away with the title

tally of points from games is just one less than their record set last
season
the statistics make impressive reading with barcelona notching wins and four
draws while they have the best defence conceding goals and the best attack
with goals
barcelona become only the fifth team to go unbeaten for the first half of the
season joining real madrid athletic bilbao espanyol and real sociedad in the
elite club
with sergi busquets injured midfielder seydou keita made timely return from
the african cup of nations following mali elimination
keita spurned good chance early on with header while messi went close on
minutes before the breakthrough goal created and scored by xavi on minutes

volley in pinpoint cross from alves
alves was causing havoc down the right and scored himself two minutes later when
his overhit cross floated into the top corner and the brazilian celebrated with
samba dance

valdes three minutes prior to xavi opener but there was sense of
inevitability that barca would win after going up so early on

goals last weekend finished fine move lashing home after fine lay off from
zlatan ibrahimovic

straight defeats with home win over almeria on saturday and move level on
points with fourth placed real mallorca
spanish international alvaro negredo scored the decisive goal on nine minutes to

tiredness brought on by playing in the league kings cup and champions league
there are no words to express how proud am of the team said jimenez at
half time there were three players wanting to change fatigue is beginning to
show because of all the competitions we are playing in
it was only negredo fifth of difficult debut season since his club record
million euro move from real madrid but it is vital one to stop the losing
sequence and push sevilla closer to the champions league spots
almeria are two points above the relegation zone as new coach juanma lillo
struggles to guide the club to safety
sevilla certainly had the rain soaked pitch to thank for their goal with
acasiete back pass to goalkeeper diego alves stopping suddenly due to the wet
turf and renato was on hand to lay off to negredo who rolled the ball into the
empty net
negredo seemed almost embarrassed to score the goal against old club almeria
where he spent two seasons scoring goals in games before real decided to
sell him to sevilla

berlin jan afp
germany is to speed up the training of afghan security forces making this its
primary task in the country chancellor angela merkel said saturday ahead of an
international conference on afghanistan
we are going to focus our military mission principally on training security
forces merkel said in her weekly internet blog
germany is chiefly engaged in northern afghanistan and that is where we will
fulfil our training commitment in speedier and more concentrated manner than
hitherto she said
merkel said she would meet afghan president hamid karzai in berlin on tuesday
and wednesday to discuss how best to coordinate afghan and international
efforts
the chancellor was to address parliament on wednesday on the government policy
on afghanistan
berlin participation in the strong international force fighting the
taliban insurgency in afghanistan the third largest behind the united states
and britain is deeply unpopular among germans
merkel made no mention saturday of sending more german troops to afghanistan
having previously said that she would take no decision on this score before the
london conference on thursday
but defence minister karl theodor zu guttenberg told the frankfurter allgemeine
zeitung newspaper that he would present before london concrete figure for an
eventual increase of the participation of german troops
the increase would however depend on the outcome of the london meeting he said
in an interview to appear monday
foreign minister guido westerwelle who would represent berlin at the
conference also did not rule out boosting germany strong force in

tagesspiegel that the training of troops and police must be strengthened

full responsibility in every province in so that our allies serving in
afghanistan can go home
the aim was to have an army of well trained troops and police
he said
us envoy in afghanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke was quoted as saying by
the weekly der spiegel on saturday that the strategy for afghanistan is
settled and the london conference would be to implement it
but polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said it an interview due to appear
sunday that germany had no choice but to step up its troop presence in
afghanistan
it is not possible for country not to want to engage itself basically for
political or historical restraints he told welt am sonntag referring to
germany reticence to send troops abroad after world war ii
we have to leave all that behind us he said adding we have to reinforce
our efforts in afghanistan now before withdrawing as soon as possible
the minister also criticised some countries among them germany for sending
troops to afghanistan with limited mandate
when one gives an army mandate it should win and to win it has to be
equipped with good instruments the former defence minister said
german troops in afghanistan operate under mandate which prevents them from
