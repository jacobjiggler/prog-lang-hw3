glasgow jan afp
super sub andrew little rescued point for rangers as he struck last minute
equaliser to seal draw against ten man hearts at ibrox on saturday
scott robinson gave hearts the lead in the th minute just seconds after
hearts player christian nade saw red for his second bookable offence
spirited performance from the hearts defence looked to have sealed the win
before northern irishman little popped up to strike his first club for the club
the point takes the league leaders ten points clear at the top of the scottish
premier league although rivals celtic have two games in hand starting with
their match against st johnstone on sunday
in the absence of the goal partnership of kris boyd and kenny miller through
injury kyle lafferty and john fleck who between them had scored three this
season filled in up front for rangers
nade had the first real effort of the match in the fifth minute captain michael
stewart picked him out at the edge of the box but he blasted his shot high over
the bar
with some of the rangers players slow out of the blocks it was lafferty who was
first to try his luck but the northern irishman shot on the turn didn
trouble marian kello
kello had to be at his best to produce spectacular one handed save low down to
his right to prevent steven davis curling free kick creeping in
the home side threatened again from another set piece when kevin thomson
floated free kick into packed hearts box was headed just over by kirk
broadfoot
allan mcgregor had to be alert at the start of the second half when he saw
nade low drive late and got fingertip to it to force in round the post
hearts were then forced on to the back foot with sasa papac stinging the hands
of kello with yard pile driver
rangers were driving forward in search of an opener and davis and lee mcculloch
both blasted efforts well over before lafferty was presented with golden
chance to give his side the lead
fleck burst through the hearts defence at pace and slipped in the beanpole
striker but he hit his shot straight off the body of the out rushing kello
hearts were reduced to ten men in the nd minute following moment of madness
from nade
the costa rican who had been booked just three minutes beforehand for foul on
mcgregor kicked the ball away in frustration after being flagged off side and
referee calum murray quickly gave him his marching orders
however the sending off seemed to spur hearts on and they took the lead
seconds later lee wallace low drive was superbly saved by mcgregor but
robinson got in front of papac to slide the rebound into the net
rangers brought on youngsters little and gregg wylde as they chased an equaliser
but it was hearts substitute ryan wallace who came closest when his drive was
blocked by mcgregor on the line
papac blasted chance high over from ten yards before little rescued point
for rangers in the final minute
mcculloch fiercely struck shot from the edge of the box was saved by kello but
the northern irish striker was first to the rebound to strike it home to keep
rangers ten month unbeaten record at ibrox intact
