corrected germany to step up training of afghan security forces merkel
berlin jan afp
germany is to speed up the training of afghan security forces making this its
primary task in the country chancellor angela merkel said saturday ahead of an
international conference on afghanistan
we are going to focus our military mission principally on training security
forces merkel said in her weekly internet blog
germany is chiefly engaged in northern afghanistan and that is where we will
fulfil our training commitment in speedier and more concentrated manner than
hitherto she added
merkel said she would be meeting afghan president hamid karzai in berlin on
tuesday and wednesday to discuss how best to coordinate afghan and
international efforts
the chancellor was to address parliament on wednesday on the government policy
on afghanistan
berlin participation in the strong international forces fighting the
taliban insurgency where its contingent is the third largest behind the united
states and britain is deeply unpopular among germans
merkel made no mention saturday of sending more german troops to afghanistan
having previously said that she would take no decision on this score before the
london conference on thursday
however foreign minister guido westerwelle who would represent berlin at the
conference did not rule out boosting germany strong force in remarks to
be published sunday
ve never said that we would send no extra troops for example to train afghan
forces he told the bild am sonntag weekly but not giving blank
cheque
westerwelle also called for using the current contingent in the best way
afghan foreign minister rangin dadfar spanta told the daily tagesspiegel that
the training of troops and police must be strengthened
haven come to europe to ask for more soldiers he added we aim to take
full responsibility in every province in so that our allies serving in
afghanistan can go home
the aim was to have an army of well trained troops and police
he said
us envoy in afghanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke was quoted as saying by
the weekly der spiegel saturday that the strategy for afghanistan is settled
and the london conference would be to implement it

fahrenheit in bulgaria and turkey on saturday as violent snowstorms caused

and trapped train near the border with romania
man suffering heart attack died in the northeastern bulgarian region of
silistra when the ambulance he was in became trapped by snow
all roads were closed in the dobritch region also in bulgaria northeast
where the temperature on saturday reached high of minus degrees celsius
rising from minus overnight
violent winds forced the port and airport in the black sea city of varna to
close and dozens of villages were left without power
food supplies in the black sea resort of sinemorets near the turkish border
were running low after the village was cut off by almost metre of snow
bulgarian national radio reported

biden says us to appeal blackwater court decision
baghdad jan afp
vice president joe biden on saturday announced an appeal into us court
decision to drop charges against an american firm whose security guards are
accused of killing iraqi civilians in
dismissal is not an acquittal biden told reporters during visit to
baghdad referring to the case involving the five guards employed by the private
company formerly known as blackwater
today am announcing that the united states government will appeal this
decision our justice department will file that appeal next week he said
the five guards who had been part of convoy of armoured vehicles had been
charged with killing the civilians and wounding others in an attack using
guns and grenades at baghdad busy nisur square in september
charges against the blackwater employees were dismissed last year when judge
ruled us prosecutors violated their rights by using incriminating statements
they had made under immunity during state department probe
the ruling outraged the baghdad government which maintains that people were
killed
the united states is determined to hold to account anyone who commits crimes
against iraqi people biden added
while we fully respect the independence and the integrity of the us judicial
system we were disappointed with the judge decision to dismiss the indictment
which was based on the way some evidence had been acquired
the iraqi government said this week it was considering lodging its own complaint
against blackwater which has since been renamed xe to seek compensation for
the families of the victims
in his ruling on december us federal judge ricardo urbina found prosecutors
violated the guards rights by using incriminating statements they had made
under immunity during the us state department probe
the decision was welcomed by the us company but several senators including
republican presidential candidate john mccain have since voiced regret at the
ruling and called for us government appeal
but the admissibility of the iraqi government complaint is uncertain because all
of the families except one agreed damages from xe according to lawyer injured
in the incident
the lawyer hassan jabbar salman said the families of those killed were offered
dollars and those wounded received between and dollars
from the us security firm
blackwater worldwide changed its name in february following what the
company said was change of business focus
critics however suggested that the rebranding was an effort to polish an image
tarnished by an alleged culture of lawlessness and lack of accountability among
blackwater workers as they carried out their duties in iraq
biden president barack obama pointman on iraq arrived in baghdad late on
friday
the main thrust of his visit was to defuse row over the banning of hundreds of
candidates from march general election over their alleged links to executed
dictator saddam hussein

argentine foreign minister to lead china trip
buenos aires jan afp
argentine foreign minister jorge taiana said saturday he was leading trade
mission to china following president cristina kirchner announcement this week
she would not join the trip due to concerns over her own vice president
the bilateral relationship with china is of central importance to the
argentine government taiana said before departing
kirchner announced tuesday she had decided not to attend the mission fearing
that her vice president julio cobos would overstep his authority during the time
she was out of the country
argentina delegation on the china trip includes representatives from some
companies from industries such as agricultural machinery manufacturing
biotechnology textiles and leather
they aim to strike strategic partnerships with their counterparts in the
cities of beijing and shanghai the foreign ministry said
talks and business conferences kick off in beijing on monday moving south to
shanghai on wednesday and concluding on friday
bilateral trade between the nations increased from four billion dollars in
to billion dollars in making the rising asian giant argentina second
largest destination for exports according to official data
kirchner has clashed repeatedly with her vice president since but the
disagreements peaked in the last few weeks over the president attempt to
remove martin redrado as central bank chief
the cobos backed bank chief refused to dig into the bank reserves to guarantee
payment of new sovereign debt issue fearing that it could open the way
to the creditors laying claim to the bank reserves
kirchner tried to sack redrado as result despite the bank constitutional
autonomy but her order was overturned by argentina courts
the trip for her would have been long time to be absent when the country
current vice president does not fulfill the role assigned by the constitution
kirchner said tuesday

thulani serero once apiece for south africa who managed miserable goal
return from outings last year
despite the friendly billing swazi defender sihawu dlamini did not enter into
the spirit of the occasion and two yellow cards led to his expulsion minutes
from full time against an all local south africa line up
parreira who guided brazil to victory in the world cup and the quarter
finals in germany four years ago was furious after hopes of an early march
start to training camp in his homeland were dashed
club fixture clash between the south african premiership and the african
football confederation caf meant the final round of domestic league fixtures
had to be delayed one week to march and the brazil camp cut short
south african officials say the national squad will also train in germany during
april and at kempton park on the north east outskirts of johannesburg the
following month before facing mexico in the june world cup opener
bafana who changed the entire team at half time are likely to receive
greater examination of their progress after two week durban camp when they

jos nigeria jan afp
at least bodies were recovered from wells following deadly muslim christian
clashes in central nigeria village headman said saturday taking the
unofficial death toll past
so far we have picked bodies from the wells but more people are still
missing umar baza head of kuru karama village near the city of jos told afp
by telephone
we took an inventory of the displaced people from this village sheltering in
three camps and we realise that people can still not be accounted for he
said
we believe there are more bodies in the wells
the head of the muslim volunteer team for the victims burial mohammed shittu
said further searches would be carried out on saturday
now we have bodies in all taken from the wells as from thursday he told
afp
from the account of survivors some people fleeing attacks were ambushed and
killed in the bush that is why we are going there to search for more bodies
global rights watchdog human rights watch hrw on saturday urged vice president
goodluck jonathan to order an immediate criminal investigation into credible
reports of massacre of at least muslim residents of town in central
nigeria
muslim official who visited kuru karama to arrange for the burial of bodies
told hrw that corpses had been recovered including those of young
children
dozens of them were stuffed down wells or in sewage pits hrw said in
statement
the state government has given no official death toll for the violence which
broke out last sunday in jos capital of plateau state and spread to nearby
towns and villages
some people fled the fighting to take refuge in military barracks
churches and mosques around the city according to the red cross as the
government called in the army to restore order
religious leaders and medical workers said they had counted bodies by
wednesday before the dead started to be recovered from kuru karama muslim
enclave in christian region kilometres miles south of jos
another bodies were found and buried saturday in jos cemetery
these bodies buried were picked up today saturday in two locations
affected by the violence in jos rusau and anguwar rukuba shittu told afp
hrw quoted witnesses as saying groups of armed men believed to be christians
attacked the largely muslim population of kuru karama on tuesday morning
after surrounding the town they hunted down and attacked muslim residents
some of whom had sought refuge in homes and local mosque killing many as they
tried to flee and burning many others alive the statement said
christian and muslim leaders in plateau state have both said the unrest owed
more to the failure of political leaders to address ethnic differences than to
inter faith rivalries
jonathan pledged that the ringleaders responsible for the violence would be
brought to justice and ordered the army to take over security of the affected
regions and sensitive neighbouring areas
the federal government is determined to secure convictions of the perpetrators
of this crime no matter how highly placed he said in broadcast late
thursday
jos has been hotbed of religious violence in nigeria whose million people
are divided almost equally between followers of the two faiths
an estimated people were killed in religious clashes in the city in late
