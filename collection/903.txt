victory at preston on saturday secured their place in the last of the
competition
nicolas anelka th goal of the season set carlo ancelotti team on their way
before daniel sturridge added the second the year old third goal in his
last two games
it was the perfect response after carlo ancelotti side had lost their place at
the top of the premier league table in midweek
yet the outcome might have been different had preston midfielder darren carter
not spurned glorious chance from three yards when the score was
chelsea are looking to become the first team to defend the fa cup since arsenal
mounted successful defence of the competition in
ancelotti took the unusual step of revealing his starting line up on the eve of
the tie the italian opting to make six changes to the side which hammered
sunderland last saturday
portuguese keeper hilario and sturridge were among those handed rare start
although key players frank lampard john terry and nicolas anelka were also on
duty against the championship club
preston are languishing in the bottom half of the second tier after losing their
last three league games
yet the hosts gave as good as they got in the opening exchanges chris brown
causing panic inside the chelsea defence after getting on the end of chris
sedgwick eighth minute cross
chelsea who thrashed preston league rivals watford in the previous round
took while to get into their stride
keeper andy lonergan did well to deny russian midfielder yury zhirkov in the
th minute before chelsea had goal disallowed in controversial circumstances
moments after lampard had been fouled on the edge of the area substitute
florent malouda had the ball in the back of the net only for referee mike dean
to rule it out and award chelsea free kick for the illegal challenge on their
midfielder
chelsea were beginning to build some momentum lonergan beating away fiercely
struck free kick by alex before anelka found the vital breakthrough in the th
minute
the former manchester city and arsenal forward made it five goals in four games
following an excellent low finish from an angle after getting the better of youl
mawene defender sean st ledger blocking the view of his keeper and deflecting
the ball into the net
yet despair doubled four minutes later when they spurned glorious chance to
equalise carter slicing the loose ball over the bar after hilario parried
brown strong header
it was stunning miss and one that ultimately proved preston downfall as
chelsea doubled their advantage within three minutes of the restart
corner by malouda was met by terry whose header was kept out by lonergan
however the rebound fell to sturridge who made no mistake from close range
to their credit preston continued to battle but chelsea should have won by
more handsome margin
michael ballack was denied by fine lonergan save while lampard also went close
before the england midfielder was replaced by joe cole
deco who has appeared on an infrequent basis under ancelotti bossed the
midfield well as chelsea produced professional performance
sturridge was unfortunate not to add his second goal when his fierce yard
effort whistled narrowly wide in the nd minute

india carmaker maruti profit triples
new delhi jan afp
india biggest carmaker maruti suzuki said saturday its quarterly net profit
more than tripled as it announced plans to increase capacity to maintain its
dominance of the domestic market
maruti majority owned by japan suzuki motor corp said net profit during the
fiscal third quarter soared to billion rupees million dollars from
billion rupees year earlier
the performance fuelled by cheap loans and reviving domestic economy beat
analyst expectations that profit for the three months to december would be
around billion rupees
this has been good quarter said maruti chief financial officer ajay seth
as he announced the company would expand capacity to defend its market
leadership position from global rivals and meet increasing domestic demand
host of vehicle makers from general motors to renault and toyota have unveiled
plans for car launches in india to grab larger slice of the fast growing
market and counter sluggish demand in developed countries
india is now asia third largest car market outstripped only by china and
japan and is one of the few countries where automobile sales are rapidly
increasing car sales jumped percent last year to million units
maruti which sells about one in two cars in the country said sales jumped
percent to billion rupees
seth said maruti planned to invest billion rupees to make more cars
each year from april increasing total capacity from one million units
the expansion would take place at maruti plant at manesar near the indian
capital
seth said maruti could further ramp up capacity if there is need later
the car manufacturer attributed the profit increase partly to government
stimulus measures aimed at helping the industry ride out the global economic
slump
the measures have put more money into the hands of india growing middle class
favourable conditions in the domestic market supported by the government
stimulus package and ease of automobile finance helped achieve good sales the
company said in statement
nearly four fifths of cars in india are bought using loans
the central bank has cut interest rates to record lows to cushion the impact of
international financial slump
maruti domestic sales in the quarter jumped by percent to units
while exports soared by percent to vehicles spurred by european
government incentives to scrap ageing vehicles
seth said the company was cautiously optimistic about sales volumes in the
fourth quarter but added rising commodity prices would put pressure on profit
margins
we also have to keep in mind interest rates may rise as the domestic economy
recovers and it is important that government incentive measures stay in place
to help keep the market buoyant he told afp
passenger car sales are forecast to reach two million this year and are expected
to triple in the next decade boosted by higher incomes in the country of
billion people according to industry estimates

kitzbuehel austria jan afp
swiss veteran didier cuche shot out warning to pretenders to the crown of
world cup and olympic speed events with double triumph here after sealing
downhill victory on saturday
cuche made it two out of two with win down the notorious streif course to
follow up on his super success hours earlier it was the first double here
since stephan eberharter achieved the feat in
it was also cuche fourth win of the season and th overall and came after he
clocked min sec with slovenian andrej sporn at sec and italian werner
heel in third further sec adrift
think it the best weekend in my career said cuche it incredible to
nail the double that only eberharter and hermann maier in have
achieved
really very proud and offer my excuses to austria joked the swiss
racer
cuche said he did not mind that he was seen as the favourite for olympic gold in
whistler next month
it no problem for me being favourite admitted cuche who revealed he had
studied eberharter races at least times on the internet so as to inspire
him
one has to accept it and deep down it gives me great pleasure prefer to be
favourite than an outsider it reduces the pressure on me
cuche swiss team mate carlo janka remained atop the world cup overall
standings after placing th at sec ahead of austrian slalom specialist
benjamin raich who finished well down the field sec off cuche pace
sporn was ecstatic at taking podium place at such celebrated downhill
especially as he had not trained in the discipline after undergoing back
operation
it incredible to be here in kitzbuehel can only dream about this
especially after my injury last year
it has always been my dream to gain podium place here
made some mistakes at the top half but after that gave my all pushed
myself to the limit
had lost all my confidence at the beginning of the season in the american
races but happily regained it at val gardena
the course biggest casualty was that of reigning world cup downhill champion
michael walchhofer
the austrian lost his balance coming into tight turn after steep jump an
edge catching and spinning him around backwards before propelling him into the
course side safety netting
walchhofer took few moments to untangle himself from the second of the three

photographers protest against british police searches
london jan afp
thousands of photographers protested in london on saturday against the use of
anti terror laws which allow british police to stop and search suspects
trafalgar square was lit up by camera flashes as an estimated
photographers gathered to complain at what they see as the increasing tendency
of police to use the legislation to stop them taking pictures
freelance photographer and writer marc vallee who helped organise the protest
through social networking sites twitter and facebook said frustrations with
police centred on the scope of an anti terror law passed in
vallee said it quite obvious that professional photographers across the
country are being searched because they are photographers not because they are
suspicious
it common law right to take pictures in public places and we are here to
show that
many protesters waved placards bearing the slogan photographer not
terrorist
amateur photographer lucy hogan from bath in southwest england said the
support has been incredible there are so many here today even photographers
from italy
it just goes to show that it not only britain where photographers are treated
with such malicious use of the law
