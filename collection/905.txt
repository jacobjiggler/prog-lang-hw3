serbian orthodox church enthrones moderate new patriarch
belgrade jan afp
serbia powerful orthodox church saturday enthroned bishop favouring closer
ties with the vatican as its new head in ceremony in belgrade cathedral
but the new patriarch year old irinej told the congregation including top
politicians and representatives of other denominations that the church first
duty was to support the serbian state in its efforts to recover the breakaway
province of kosovo
saturday ceremony was the first part of two stage ritual with the second
part planned to take place in the historic church at pec in western kosovo at
date which has not been fixed
albanian majority kosovo viewed by serbs as the heartland of their culture
declared unilateral independence nearly two years ago and its status has been
recognised by some countries
it is great day for me but also believe for our people and our church
irinej said
he was elected saturday by the bishops in the holy synod when his name was
plucked out of hat containing short list of three
irinej is considered moderate and has signalled his openness to improving
relations with the roman catholic church that have been strained for years
in recent interview he said pope benedict xvi would be welcome to visit
something that would have been unthinkable in serbia only few years ago
the new patriarch is also known to support church reform including ending the
use of the outdated julian calendar which means serbian orthodox christmas is
celebrated two weeks after other christians mark the birth of jesus christ
irinej succeeds patriarch pavle who died in november after long illness
under pavle rule the influence of the church steadily grew after the fall of
communism in the
car bomb attack kills four in nw pakistan officials
peshawar pakistan jan afp
suicide car bomb attack killed at least four people in town in troubled
northwest pakistan on saturday police said
the attack took place close to police station in gomal kilometres
miles south of the city of tank neighbouring the taliban stronghold of south
waziristan where pakistani troops are battling islamist militants
the bomber struck outside the police station killing one policeman and
three passers by including two children district police chief ejaz abid told
afp
he said people including five policemen three passers by and three
prisoners in the police lock up were injured
this was car bomb attack which is reaction to the ongoing operation in
south waziristan region abid added
pakistan military has been focusing its most ambitious military offensive yet
against homegrown taliban militants in the tribal region deploying about
troops on october
another senior police official ghazanfar hussain also confirmed the incident and
casualties
was busy in routine desk work inside the police station when large blast
rocked the entire building hussain said
he added that one of the outer walls of the police station collapsed from the
impact of the blast while big cracks appeared in other rooms of the building
attacks blamed mostly on the taliban have killed more than people across
pakistan since july concentrated in the northwest and major cities
britain raises terror threat
london jan afp
britain has raised its terror threat assessment from substantial to severe
suggesting an attack was highly likely ahead of international meetings on
yemen and afghanistan in london next week
home secretary alan johnson announced the change on friday four weeks after the
attempted bombing of an airliner heading from amsterdam to the us city of
detroit
johnson said the joint terrorism analysis centre the assessment unit within the
mi domestic intelligence agency had taken the decision to up the threat level
this means that terrorist attack is highly likely but should stress that
there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent he said
johnson refused to say whether the amended assessment now four on scale of
five was linked to the attempted attack on the northwest airlines flight on
december
we never say what the intelligence is he said adding it shouldn be
thought to be linked to detroit or anywhere else for that matter
but us official who requested anonymity said that the implication
the us department of homeland security said the announcement brought britain in
line with us security measures introduced over the last few weeks
the year old nigerian man charged with trying to blow up the detroit bound
plane with explosives hidden in his underwear was believed to have trained in
yemen after studying in london al qaeda claims it sent him on the mission
johnson said the higher threat level meant britain put more resources in we
heighten the state of vigilance
he stressed britain continued to face real and serious threat and urged the
public to remain vigilant
the threat level was last at severe in july last year when it was downgraded
to substantial suggesting an attack remained strong possibility
alex carlile the british government independent reviewer of anti terror
legislation said the move was aimed at making the public more aware but was
not designed to scare people
he said the government has quite rightly decided that if you don tell the
public to be vigilant they re not going to be vigilant
the message from the current change of assessment is not that we should be more
afraid but that we should be little bit more vigilant than we have been
mike granatt former security official in the british government told bbc
radio the main reason for alert states is to warn people who have specific
task that they ought to do something differently they ought to be taking more
steps or they ought to move to different phase of the security plan
india has increased security at its airports and warned domestic airlines about
possible hijack attempt after tip off from western intelligence services
but there was no suggestion of any link to britain move
prime minister gordon brown on wednesday reiterated the threats britain faced as
he announced the suspension of direct flights from yemen until new security
measures were in place
brown said the afghanistan pakistan border remained the crucible of terrorism
but the failed detroit attack highlighted the threat from yemen based militants
meeting in britain on wednesday was aimed at strengthening international
support for yemen in its efforts to combat al qaeda
the day after president hamid karzai would attend high level conference in
london on the way forward in violence scarred afghanistan us secretary of state
hillary clinton would also take part
britain has been targeted by number of attempted bombings in recent years
following the attacks of july when four suicide bombers killed
themselves and others on the london transport system
since the threat levels have been made public they have twice briefly been
raised to the top critical level meaning an attack was expected imminently
the first time was in august after plot to down transatlantic airliners
was uncovered and the second in june after car bombs failed to detonate
in london and burning jeep was driven into glasgow airport in an attempted
attack

another massive quake threatens haiti seismologists warn
washington jan afp
another earthquake is threatening to hit haiti with as much if not more force
than the massive temblor that leveled port au prince seismologists said urging
the country to rebuild with strict norms
aftershocks have already rattled the impoverished caribbean nation in the days
following the january quake that killed over people left nearly
homeless and injured scores more
on wednesday magnitude temblor struck people already scrambling to
rebuild their tattered lives
but more are likely on their way the us geological survey usgs estimated on
thursday that there was percent probability that one or several magnitude
aftershocks could strike in the coming weeks although they will space out more
and more over time
if the devastating magnitude quake that hit nearly two weeks ago freed much of
the tension accumulated on one portion of the enriquillo plantain garden fault
zone another segment east of the epicenter and adjacent to haiti capital
port au prince has barely moved according to the usgs
yet part of this fault zone accumulated more strain due to the sliding of north
american and caribbean tectonic plates that could unleash all that strength at
any moment without warning
the geological agency based its predictions on preliminary measures of
deformations using radar satellite and aerial imagery
we just know from other earthquakes worldwide and from the history of haiti
that large earthquakes can occur close in time usgs seismologist david
schwartz told afp not one of us would be surprised
citing turkey which experienced two earthquakes above magnitude seven just
three months apart in schwartz warned similar scenario could take place
in haiti
the enriquillo fault zone which runs along the southern portion of the island
of hispaniola shared by haiti and the dominican republic could generate
tremor measuring up to slightly higher than the original quake
according to eric calais seismologist at purdue university
earthquakes in this region tend to repeat themselves in sequences he said in
an interview noting that similarly large temblors have shaken haiti at least
four times in the past three centuries including those of and which
completely destroyed port au prince
port au prince must be rebuilt according to strict seismic norms
some nuclear plants that can resist magnitude earthquakes are now being built
he noted
the usgs said an in depth evaluation of the quake risk for haiti and other
caribbean countries would provide the basis to establish and improve
construction norms in order to eventually erect more resistant buildings
but this would require extensive geological assessments of faults soil
conditions strain accumulations and studies of recent seismic patterns and
activity
calais lamented the scant attention seismologists have paid to haiti in recent
years only two teams of experts including one from purdue university where he
teaches have worked in the country in the past years they had already
warned about the risk of new powerful quake
he planned to travel to haiti on monday with battery of instruments to
coordinate the first seismic study since the killer quake

port au prince jan afp
haiti government has ended the search and rescue phase of the quake relief
effort after two people who spent days buried under rubble were pulled out
alive and the death toll soared to more than
the united nations said people had been saved from debris but that the
government has declared the search and rescue phase over
there were live rescues by international search and rescue teams the un
organisation for the coordination of humanitarian affairs added in its latest
situation report on the relief effort
an year old woman and year old man defied the odds by being rescued from
the rubble in port au prince on friday
but over days since the magnitude quake the united nations said the
haitian government declared the rescue effort over at pm gmt on
friday
as deliveries of food water shelter and medical care to hundreds of thousands
of people scaled up in port au prince and the worst affected towns of jacmel and
leogane huge relocation of survivors was also underway
the number of people leaving port au prince is increasing daily the un added
on saturday as more than people took advantage of the government
offer of free transport to other cities
the total number of people leaving port au prince by private means remains
undetermined it added
in port au prince on friday first supply of food was distributed in front of
the champ de mars central plaza which had become huge refugee camp water
tankers and toilet blocks were set up electricity was being installed
our pathetic awful life will be easier it seems will finally be able to
sleep tonight said suze jean francois one of the first to be given tent at
the site
now will finally be able to gather my thoughts and mourn she added
referring to her daughter who died in the quake
many however remained living in squalid conditions waiting for assistance
while hospitals reported heart rending cases such as four year old with
cerebral palsy who was abandoned on doorstep
the child was left with message saying this little boy has no father and no
mother whoever cares about him is his family according to doctors and nurses
at french field hospital in port au prince
the bed field hospital which french police installed where the french high
school once stood was also looking after six quadriplegics with nowhere to go
these people are completely paralyzed they no longer have home or family
they need someone to take care of them constantly said colonel michel orcel
doctor
the world food programme said saturday it had scaled up its food aid to quake
survivors and distributed two million meals on friday up from million on
thursday
we are getting the job done even if we wish we could do more quicker the
agency executive director josette sheeran said after two day evaluation
mission to the capital port au prince
words cannot describe the devastation that has been wrought on haiti by the
january earthquake she said adding tribute to wfp haiti staff
ninety percent of them have lost their homes all of them are grieving the loss
of friends and loved ones and yet they have returned to work with remarkable
resilience of spirit and determination to help their country back to its feet
was able to spend time with them camping out in tents as all our staff are
doing and listening to their heartbreaking stories of loss salute them and
admire them deeply she added
up to search and rescue teams with staff and dogs had combed the
ruins of port au prince and towns and villages in south haiti in the search for
signs or life under collapsed homes and buildings
aid workers said the number of people pulled out were record for such
disaster
haiti interior ministry said friday the confirmed death toll from the quake
now stood at it said more than people were injured and more
than were living in temporary camps
the us geological survey said the haiti disaster has already gone down in
history as the most destructive on record in this region
that probably accurate that this is the most deadly quake to occur in this
part of the world usgs geophysicist dale grant told afp

sri lanka opposition warns of violence vote rigging
colombo jan afp
sri lanka opposition warned saturday of possible vote rigging and violence by
the ruling party in next week presidential election as both sides wound up
campaigning
ahead of final campaign rallies later on saturday opposition candidate sarath
fonseka predicted that the ruling party led by president mahinda rajapakse
would use violence to intimidate his supporters in tuesday vote
they want to create violence and discourage people from voting lower turnout
will help rigging he told reporters adding he expected fake voters and forged
ballot papers to also be used
in the run up to the poll police say at least four people have been killed and
hundreds wounded in clashes between rival supporters the house of an
influential opposition figure was bombed on friday
fonseka said he and his allies would rely on the protection of the security
forces most of whom he said would vote for him except for few senior figures
who are trying to please the government
we can counter violence with violence we have to abide by the law he said
sri lanka government has denied it has been behind the wave of election
related unrest and rajapakse office said friday that he was gravely
concerned over the escalating violence
instructions have been given to the authorities to bolster security at
sensitive locations and all political events up to and on polling day to ensure
that all sri lankans can participate safely in the electoral process the
government said in statement
independent election commissioner dayananda dissanayake told reporters friday he
would order re poll if any violence was used against voters
fonseka former army chief fielded series of questions about the
possibility of an army coup against him if he wins the vote and the movement of
armoured vehicles into colombo as tension rose in the capital
but he said there would be no popular support for coup and that he had full
confidence in the army
group of fonseka supporters wearing green caps and party shirts walked
noisily behind procession of rickshaws on the streets outside the venue of his
press conference
fonseka and rajapakse were to finish campaigning at rallies planned in and
around colombo later saturday
poll officials said all arrangements were in place to conduct the election
although less than sixth of the ethnic tamil war displaced civilians
had applied to vote
elections chief dissanayake said he was arranging buses for ethnic tamils
in the island former war zones to travel to polling booths on tuesday because
of fears that they may not have enough public transport
both rajapakse and fonseka are members of the majority sinhalese community which
is seen split between the two men in the event of close contest the minority
tamil vote is seen as being crucial deciding factor
tuesday election the first peace time presidential poll takes place after
bitter intensely personal campaign between the architects of the country
victory over rebel forces in may
president rajapakse told reporters last week that the campaign failed to bring
about an informed debate on issues and instead had degenerated into mud
slinging charge made by fonseka too
rajapakse handpicked fonseka to be his army chief in and the two men were
victorious allies on the battlefield last year against the tamil tiger rebels
but are now sworn enemies at the ballot box
the poll marks the first time in years that sri lankans have gone to polls
without the influence of the tigers who fought brutal war for tamil
homeland before being crushed by government forces in may

biden calls for fair credible transparent iraq election
baghdad jan afp
us vice president joe biden said on saturday iraq march election must be
fair credible and transparent but insisted that washington would not interfere
in simmering row over barred candidates
biden landed in baghdad late on friday for hours of discussions aimed at
brokering compromise over controversial blacklist that has seen both sunni
arabs and shiites excluded just six weeks from the poll
foreign minister hoshyar zebari told afp that biden early talks had focused on
general diplomatic relations between the two countries and security matters but
the elections had also been discussed
he made the point that they want to see transparent fair election that has
credibility both for the iraqi people and foreign people but how you do it is
your business said zebari who attended some of the meetings
zebari however stressed biden fully accepted that the dispute was for iraqi
leaders to resolve
everyone is aware that the time until the elections is closing and this issue
has to be resolved through legal means zebari said referring to an appeals
process through which barred candidates can have the decision reversed
government spokesman ali al dabbagh added he biden clearly said that this is
an iraqi issue and he is not willing to interfere with the legal and
constitutional process
the strong blacklist is filled with candidates accused of being members of
executed dictator saddam hussein outlawed baath party feared fedayeen men of
sacrifice militia or mukhabarat intelligence agency
the dispute has stoked tension between the shiite majority now leading the
government and the sunni arab former elite and has also exposed the failings of
much vaunted but apparently stumbling national reconciliation process
biden met prime minister nuri al maliki parliament speaker iyad al samarrai and
the un secretary general special representative for iraq ad melkert
he was also scheduled to meet president jalal talabani as well as senior
government ministers and cross section of other political leaders
senior white house aide earlier insisted that biden was not wading into the
row but would listen and then give his advice if asked
we want to be as helpful as the iraqis want us to be in helping them resolve
these problems tony blinken biden national security adviser told
reporters
saleh al mutlak leading sunni mp and persistent critic of the shiite
dominated government is among those who have been barred although maliki has
denied that sunnis have been targeted ahead of the election
the election row sparked flurry of contacts by biden in recent days aimed at
brokering compromise notably through president talabani who is kurd
biden proposed that the disqualifications be deferred until after the election
and that those candidates who have been barred condemn and disavow the baath
party and undertake to act through democratic means talabani said before biden
landed in baghdad
elections chief faraj al haidari told afp more candidates could yet be barred
from the ballot with the defence and interior ministries publishing lists
naming individuals who have criminal records or false diplomas
biden has repeatedly voiced concern about lingering feuds between iraq shiite
sunni and kurdish communities causing obstacles to political progress
on friday the iraqi government said the disqualified candidates would have to
denounce saddam regime and its crimes in order to reintegrate into society
without specifically offering reinstatement on ballot papers
