broke out last sunday in jos capital of plateau state and later spread to
nearby towns and villages but religious leaders and medical workers said they

tennis federer and serena move up gear
melbourne jan afp
top seeds roger federer and serena williams moved up gear saturday with
straight sets wins as they closed in on more silverware at the australian open
the world premier players have grand slam titles between them and both look
primed to add to their collections
the swiss great made short work of spanish st albert montanes
while williams completed demolition of carla suarez navarro as the
fourth round of the opening grand slam of the season took shape
also staying on track was men third seed novak djokovic sixth seed nikolay
davydenko ninth seed fernando verdasco and local hope lleyton hewitt
joining williams in the women draw was sister venus seventh seed victoria
azarenka ninth seeded vera zvonareva and th seeded samantha stosur
federer with grand slam titles now faces round of clash against
hewitt who was in good touch against marcos baghdatis before the cypriot
retired with shoulder injury while trailing
ve come through difficult draw feel physically fine and mentally fresh
but the opponents will get tougher from here said federer
so far it been great obviously you elevate your game gradually as the
opponents get harder so happy the way feel
williams will next take on the imposing and super fit stosur
the australian th seed outclassed italy alberta brianti and is
gunning for another crack at williams who she beat when they last met in
stanford in july
we ve had couple of close matches the last two times we ve played and got
the last one so going to ride with that and go into the match feeling pretty
confident stosur said
williams was also looking forward to the rematch
think she playing great she beat me the last time we played so she has
lot of momentum ton of momentum she said
definitely expect the crowd to root for sam hopefully my mom will cheer for
me should be fine
sister venus set up fourth round clash with italian th seed francesca
schiavone by beating australian casey dellacqua
also pushing through were azarenka who destroyed italy tathiana garbin
and zvonareva winner over argentine gisela dulko
they will play each other for place in the quarters
think did very well today had good game plan and definitely played
to it very well said azarenka

chinese hope li na also stayed in the tournament with battling three set win
over off court friend daniela hantuchova
like federer serbian third seed djokovic the champion was also in
imposing form as he destroyed uzbekistan denis istomin
think at some stage in the tournament you want to have straight sets win
an easy win so you can get fast off the court and try to save all the energy as
much as you can for the upcoming challenges said djokovic
so it was good to have the match like this
he will next play unseeded pole lukasz kubot who was handed free ride when
russian th seed mikhail youzhny withdrew with wrist injury
russian sixth seed davydenko stayed on the boil with hammering
of argentina juan monaco and now faces tough match against ninth seeded
fernando verdasco
the spaniard booked his place in the last when austrian stefan koubek retired
with virus after losing the first set of their match
of course you never want guy to be sick and to feel like this but it also
good as have more rest for an important match in fourth round said verdasco
who made the semis here last year
