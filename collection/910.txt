biden meets iraqi leaders over barred candidates row
baghdad jan afp
us vice president joe biden headed into talks with iraqi leaders on saturday
aiming to defuse simmering row over the barring of hundreds of election
candidates linked to saddam hussein
biden arrived in baghdad late on friday for what is expected to be up to
hours of discussions to broker compromise over controversial blacklist that
has seen both sunni arabs and shiites excluded from the march poll
he was due to meet prime minister nuri al maliki president jalal talabani
parliament speaker iyad al samarrai as well as senior government ministers and
cross section of other political leaders
his first scheduled meeting on saturday however was with the un secretary
general special representative for iraq ad melkert
senior white house aide insisted biden was not wading into the row but would
listen and then give his advice if asked
we want to be as helpful as the iraqis want us to be in helping them resolve
these problems tony blinken biden national security adviser told
reporters
because ultimately those problems are what stands between iraq and
successful stable future
the strong blacklist is filled with candidates accused of being members of
saddam outlawed baath party the executed dictator feared fedayeen men of
sacrifice militia or his mukhabarat intelligence agency
the dispute has stoked tension between the shiite majority now leading the
government and the sunni arab former elite
it also threatens to create campaign battleground where past quarrels will be
exposed rather than healed under much vaunted but stumbling national
reconciliation process between the country communities analysts have said
saleh al mutlak leading sunni mp and persistent critic of the shiite
dominated government is among those who have been barred although maliki has
denied that sunnis have been targeted ahead of the election
ahead of biden trip foreign minister hoshyar zebari said some form of
intervention was necessary he told afp the vice president was here to salvage
the electoral process
if there are delays in publishing the final candidates list it will affect
the us withdrawal process also he said
blinken however said the timeline for the us withdrawal all combat troops
are scheduled to leave the country by august ahead of complete military
pullout in remains on track
the election row sparked flurry of contacts by biden in recent days aimed at
brokering compromise notably through president talabani who is kurd
biden proposed that the disqualifications be deferred until after the election
and that those candidates who have been barred condemn and disavow the baath
party and undertake to act through democratic means talabani said
elections chief faraj al haidari told afp more candidates could yet be barred
from the ballot with the defence and interior ministries publishing lists
naming individuals who have criminal records or false diplomas
biden has repeatedly voiced concern about lingering feuds between iraq shiite
sunni and kurdish communities causing obstacles to political progress
on friday the iraqi government said the disqualified candidates would have to
denounce saddam regime and its crimes in order to reintegrate into society
without specifically offering reinstatement on ballot papers
the baathists must declare their innocence and condemn the crimes and
failings of saddam hussein regime and the baath party government spokesman
ali al dabbagh said

china pop stars face fine for lip syncing
beijing jan afp
two chinese pop stars have become the first victims of ban on the use of lip
syncing in concerts introduced last year following controversy over the beijing
olympics opening ceremony
starlets yin youcan and fang ziyuan resorted to miming during concert they
gave in september in the southwest province of sichuan the beijing news
reported saturday
it was the first case brought against lip syncing performers since the
authorities introduced the ban the beijing youth daily said
the ministry for culture in august issued regulation allowing for fines for
singers who lip synced saying the practice misled the public
the two young singers will have to pay total fine of yuan about
dollars according to authorities quoted by the newspaper
in the organisers of the beijing olympics caused controversy when it was
revealed the young chinese girl who sang at the opening ceremony had been
miming
they defended the move and triggered further uproar by saying the real singer
was not pretty enough for spectacle shown around the world
tennis venus benefits from off season work
melbourne jan afp
changes to her game in the off season helped venus williams reach the australian
open fourth round saturday and remain on track to meet sister serena in the
semi finals
the seven time grand slam champion beat tenacious australian casey dellacqua
and said she was always working to keep her place among the
sport elite
in the off season always thinking of ways to improve and add to my game
she said
obviously with professional sports you can remain stagnant
every off season thinking of which ways can play better she added
before declining to say exactly what changes she had made
whatever the adjustments were they seemed to work as williams won the first set
comfortably
however she was made to work lot harder for the second by the australian who
is returning to the tour after recovering from shoulder surgery
in the end it took the sixth seed one hour minutes to subdue dellacqua and
book fourth round meeting with th seeded italian francesca schiavone who
upset th seed agnieszka radwanska earlier in the day
obviously big part of her game is her foot speed williams said of
schiavone
she moves really well she also just really determined and has fighting
spirit
feel like she does everything well off both sides good forehand and
backhand pretty strong serve she really just does everything well
williams played well initially against dellacqua breaking her twice in the
first set but found the australian left hander serve lot harder to read in
the second
at the same time williams serve which had worked well early went off the boil
allowing dellacqua to stay in the match
but williams recovered in the tiebreak and cleared away to lead which the
australian wildcard never looked likely to pin back
it was my third lefty in row which is little unusual williams said
you know hopefully ll be able to get back into the rhythm of playing right
handers
but think she played really well in the second set had lot of chances to
go up breaks at or and she just hung in there and kept playing tough
played really good tiebreaker so that was good
australia police seek leads in indian murder
sydney jan afp
australian police prepared saturday to reenact the final movements of an indian
man fatally stabbed earlier this month as another victim claimed he was beaten
because of his race
nitin garg was attacked as he walked from melbourne yarraville train
station through parkland on january he managed to stagger to nearby
hamburger restaurant where he was due to start an evening shift before
collapsing from fatal stab wounds
his murder and spate of other attacks against indian nationals inflamed
diplomatic tensions with new delhi this week warning the violence could damage
relations
homicide squad detective david snare said police would reconstruct garg
movements from the time he left the train until he arrived at the restaurant in
the hope it would jog someone memory or prompt witness to come forward
someone in the community knows who has committed this horrendous crime said
snare we are hopeful that they will come forward with that vital information
and assist us to take the investigation further
the police move came as the most recent victim year old taxi driver sandeep
goyal said in court that he was beaten by passengers who refused to pay him
because he was indian the australian newspaper reported
goyal was hospitalised with facial cuts after being assaulted early friday in
the queensland state capital brisbane
this is very bad experience am having in australia goyal told the
australian if the assaults don stop then will go back home
charges were laid saturday over second attack in brisbane in which year
old man was punched in the head and robbed of his wallet at phone booth
indians in queensland said they feared the incidents were part of broader
worsening problem
firmly do believe that it is part of the chain reaction and it is copycat
the state indian community spokesman umesh chandra told public radio
here it is right on our doorstep and there is fear that this could
escalate
but acting queensland police commissioner kathy rynders insisted that the
incidents were not racially motivated
both complainants in these matters have said there were no comments in relation
to their ethnicity by the offenders during last night attack rynders said
prime minister kevin rudd on thursday urged india to keep the regrettable
violence in perspective saying it was not isolated to indian nationals and
should be viewed in the context of broader incidences of violence
