abortion doctor killer goes on trial in kansas
wichita kansas jan afp
tight security enveloped kansas court friday as the trial of man who admits
to killing prominent abortion doctor got underway with sometimes graphic
testimony
but in her opening statement sedgwick county district attorney nola foulston
never mentioned abortion the reason that defendant scott roeder said he was
driven to kill george tiller
roeder is charged with first degree murder in the shooting death of
tiller one of handful of us doctors to perform late term abortions into the
third trimester which is legal under kansas state law
the doctor had been lightning rod for anti abortion foes who nicknamed him
tiller the baby killer
but sedgwick county district judge warren wilbert has said he will not allow
roeder trial to be turned into forum on the issue of abortion deeply
divisive issue in the united states
prosecutors have tried to keep roeder attorneys from suggesting that he is
guilty of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter
under kansas law voluntary manslaughter can apply if defendant acts on an
unreasonable but honest belief that he is preventing harm to himself or
others
roeder has admitted killing tiller in the foyer of tiller church saying he
did so to protect unborn children but so far the judge has not ruled on what
evidence roeder may introduce in his defense
witness kathy wegner who attended the same church as tiller testified she was
in the foyer when the doctor was shot
saw out of my right vision flash and heard popping wegner said her
voice breaking then saw dr tiller just fall flat on his back
saw an assailant with his hand out and he still had the gun in his hand
as the next witness wichita patrolman erik landon testified photograph of
tiller blood spattered body was shown to jurors on big screen tv while his
widow jeanne seated in the courtroom gallery lowered her head
landon said he saw what appeared to be single gunshot wound to tiller head
and believed it was contact wound because of the way the flesh was peeling
away from it
veterinarian paul ryding testified he had reached tiller side about
seconds after hearing gunshot tiller was bleeding heavily from gunshot to
the head had stopped breathing and appeared to have no pulse
ryding said his attempts to revive him failed was aware it was probably not
going to work ryding testified but couldn not do nothing
ryding said he had also seen roeder in the reformation luthernan church in late
he was not there to worship ryding said there was another agenda
there were some legal skirmishes friday as prosecutors tried to stop defense
attorneys from mentioning abortion
as bomb sniffing dog and about six sheriff deputies patrolled the
courthouse prosecutors detailed the preparations made by roeder in the days and
hours before he shot tiller to death on may
district attorney foulston said that two weeks before the killing roeder bought
handgun from pawnshop in lawrence kansas but had to wait week to pick it
up under state law
he then bought ammunition and was seen in tiller church the sunday before the
killing when tiller was out of town and absent from services
the day before tiller death roeder took target practice with the handgun at
his brother kansas property foulston said
he also took the gun to gunshop where he learned it had been jamming because
he was using the wrong caliber ammunition the night before tiller death
roeder checked into hotel about two miles kilometer from the church
the trial got underway on the th anniversary of the landmark us supreme court
decision in roe wade that legalized abortion in the united states
the national organization for women had scheduled memorial service for tiller
in wichita late friday

alternative forum is chosen the pentagon said

sheikh mohammed are currently being held at the controversial detention
facility at guantanamo bay cuba but are to be transferred to new york for
trial
president barack obama decision to prosecute the men before civilian us

as defendants in civilian trial

seek to hold some guantanamo detainees indefinitely and without charge

insufficient for criminal trial the washington post said
obama pledged shortly after coming into office to close guantanamo within
year deadline that expired friday
