anticipating victory over ghana to continue the cup party but the festive mood
evaporated after asamoah gyan first half goal sent ghana and not angola into
thursday semi final
crowds who had gathered around crackling television sets hung their heads in
disbelief at the sound of the final whistle and the realisation that their team
was out of the competition
bars emptied almost as quickly as luanda th november stadium and people
made their way back home quietly lost for words
the jubilation of beating malawi and the anticipation of qualifying was
distant memory as angolan fans watched their team cup of nations dream
disappear
student edgar antonio lives in holland but came back to angola to watch the

football nine man inter stun milan to go nine clear
milan jan afp
nine man inter milan moved nine points clear at the top of serie after
victory over arch rivals ac milan in pulsating derby at the san siro on
sunday
the champions played for more than an hour with numerical disadvantage after
wesley sneijder was sent off but they dominated throughout to earn richly
deserved victory
inter coach jose mourinho said that decision showed that the authorities are
ganging up on his club
tonight everything was done to try to stop inter winning but this group is
strong and will win the title he said
when went into the changing rooms at half time asked the referee why he
sent off sneijder and he told me it was because he had applauded him
he asked me what would do if player ironically applauded one of my
decisions no replied wouldn have chased him away we re football men
hence understood that this dismissal did not happen just like that
milan may still have game in hand on their neighbours but the psychological
effect of such crushing defeat will make the gap seem all the wider
milan coach leonardo seemed unsure about his side title chances now
don know think we ll keep going along the path we ve taken still
believe in the way we play he said
we did some incredible things in previous games we ve done much to have got
here in second place two points ahead of as roma with game in hand we ve got
cup match to come and we still have to play manchester united in the champions
league
milan may have come into the game as the form team in serie but inter were
clearly the more pumped up early on
sneijder almost fired them in front with moment of outrageous skill flicking
the ball up and thrashing yard volley that glanced off the outside of the
post
the dutch playmaker should then have given the hosts the lead as ricochet from
goran pandev shot fell into his path as he broke into the box but he rammed
his shot straight at goalkeeper dida
milan didn seem to heed those warnings and inter deservedly took the lead on
minutes as pandev ball over the top saw diego milito get behind ignazio
abate in the inside left channel and shoot low across dida and into the far
corner
inter were rampant and another break saw pandev feed milito on the inside right
but dida blocked his near post shot
inter were dominant and sneijder was running the show but the referee changed
that before the half hour was even up
inter centre back lucio burst forward into midfield and went down rather easily
under challenge but seeing that he still had the ball he got up and went to
carry on only for the referee to stop the game and book him for diving
inter were incensed and sneijder sarcastic gesture saw him sent off
sneijder was beside himself and needed to be dragged from the field by two team
mates
inter knuckled down though with stalwarts javier zanetti and esteban cambiasso
looking to control the midfield
milan were disjointed and struggling to create anything with their best chance
coming from heavily deflected andrea pirlo free kick that wrong footed julio
cesar but looped up and landed on the roof of the net
milan came flying out in the second half and julio cesar saved close range
clarence seedorf header from david beckham corner before ronaldinho hit
swivelling volley just wide
inter were still dangerous on the counter and milito almost made milan pay with
one break but the visitors were gradually imposing themselves with beckham
crosses from the right causing particular bother as marco borriello headed one
just over
but then from another brilliant break milito slipped in pandev who chipped dida
only to see the ball come back off the post and into the brazilian grateful
arms
but on minutes giuseppe favalli brought down maicon on the edge of the box
and pandev stepped up to curl home free kick dida could do nothing about
tellingly it was only then that mourinho removed one of his forwards
milan disappointment for all but the beginning of the second half could only
muster wild pot shots from distance in the closing stages
in injury time lucio was dismissed for second booking as he gave away
penalty but julio cesar plunged to his right to beat out ronaldinho effort and
complete milan misery
earlier in the day napoli won at livorno to move to within point of third
placed as roma while palermo defeat of fiorentina moved them up to fifth

algeria looked to be heading home early after opening their cup campaign with
poor loss to malawi but win over mali and goalless draw against angola
put them into the last eight and now they have the final in their sights
this victory is for algeria some people won be able to speak now we ve
silenced our critics and proved that we are worthy world cup finalists said
year old bougherra
earlier in sunday first quarter final angola crashed out losing to
another world cup bound team ghana to end their dreams of winning the title on

four time winners ghana seeking their fifth continental crown after yawning

sunday morning in portugal
angola welcomed back their three goal hero flavio but it was ghana missing
raft of top players who shot into th minute lead thanks to asamoah gyan

algeria clawed back from the brink of elimination to stun title favourites ivory
coast on sunday and reach the africa cup of nations semi finals
the winners fell behind on minutes to brilliant abdulkader keita goal
only for madjid bougherra to level in stoppage time and unmarked substitute

victory for algeria sets up the prospect of last four showdown with bitter
rivals egypt who they deprived of place at the world cup in south africa
after play off
defending champons egypt face four time winners cameroon on monday in clash of
giants but the teams will struggle to match the drama of this encounter
ivory coast entered the second quarter final with far superior record than
algeria at this stage of the biennial african football showcase having won four
of five ties while their rivals lost all three
there was one enforced change in the ivorian elephants line up with guy demel
from german bundesliga outfit hamburg replacing suspended emmanuel eboue in the
back four
algeria introduced fit again defender antar yahia in place of ill abdelkader
laifaoui for his first appearance of the tournament and midfielder mourad meghni
took the place of bouazza
tradition favoured the elephants with two wins and draw from four previous
clashes with the desert foxes in match between countries with one nations
cup title each to their credit
as the match kicked off amid steamy evening conditions in this oil rich northern
angola enclave the chief concern of ivory coast coach vahid halilhodzic was
rustiness with their last match nine days ago
algeria had point to prove after accusations they and angola had fixed
goalless group draw in luanda to ensure both qualified at the expense of mali
but if the ivorians were rusty it did not show on four minutes as they reacted
quickest in goalmouth scramble and kalou struck the ball past goalkeeper
faouzi chaouchi to give the west africans perfect start
early attacking traffic was heading largely toward the goal of the white kit
algerians and rafik halliche was lucky to escape unpunished when he fouled
drogba inside the area and ivory coast should have been awarded penalty
algeria were gradually showing more confidence and coming at their opponents and
after coming close few times the north africans deservedly equalised as half
time approached
lofted pass toward the ivorian penalty area missed friend and foe and fell
invitingly for matmour from borussia moenchengladbach who left boubacar barry
helpless with shot that flew in off post
fascinating see saw struggle continued to offer scoring chances at each end
with drogba narrowly failing to reach kalou crossed and barry foiling matmour
when he broke through and had only the goalkeeper to beat
but the miss of the second half came five minutes from full time when kouassi
gervinho yao burst clear when bougherra failed to intercept pass only to
blaze over with just chaouchi to beat
in sensational climax to regulation time keita scored six minutes after
replacing kalou with candidate for goal of the tournament unleashing an
unstoppable shot from outside the area into the roof of the net
algeria refused to surrender however and unmarked defender bougherra was first
to cross on minutes and headed the ball down and up over barry to take
thriller into extra time
