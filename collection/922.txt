looters in their wake
the cme health commission told me that they expected figure of dead
by monday communications minister marie lawrence jocelyn lassegue told afp
referring to those bodies that have been found and counted
it very difficult to estimate how many more people might be dead but the
prime minister has spoken of she added previously haitian health
officials had quoted figure of just over dead
aid workers have been moving into the recovery phase after the government
officially called off search and rescue efforts after days but french rescue
workers said on sunday they had detected what might be another survivor
we detected movement on radar we don know what it is it could be an
animal or person we have been digging since and it will take hours
commandant philippe chaussinaid of french civil defense told afp
hundreds of thousands of haitians remained in desperate need of food water and
shelter despite large scale us military intervention and un run aid program
in port au prince earthmovers demolished damaged buildings and cleared downtown
rubble spewing rotting corpses into the streets and opening new routes for
looters to swarm through the ruins
haitian police shouted out from time to time to deter the gangs but with little
conviction and less success we won do anything there nothing we can do
one of them said on rue du miracle
police detained three looters who were raiding pharmacy and forced them to the
ground come quickly the situation is degenerating police officer barked
into his radio calling for backup
we re not here to kill people said an officer who declined to give his name
the looters are everywhere
police eventually released the detained looters
what can do we have no jail the officer said
international donors meanwhile prepared to meet monday in montreal to discuss
rebuilding haiti after the quake which killed at least people in the
worst recorded disaster ever to hit the americas
in the skeletal shadow of port au prince shattered roman catholic cathedral
father glanda toussaint held mass at an altar improvised on wooden table
before the january quake around people would fill the pews at the
cathedral when toussaint asked today congregation of around if they
understood why the disaster happened the crowd murmured their incomprehension
all is not the will of god but all is providential he said what we are
going through is not finished we must reconstruct the country and reconstruct
our faith as haitian it hurts
during the mass immediately in front of the cathedral at least two rotting
corpses could be seen still trapped in the rubble of its collapsed wall
with the potential for chaos rising the new un chief of mission in haiti called
for more manpower and vehicles and said that clearing rubble and counting
victims could take years
need manpower need soldiers edmond mulet whose predecessor was killed
when the un headquarters in port au prince collapsed in the january quake
told cnn
the influx of us troops whose number is set to reach on sunday was
vital for getting the food and assistance that had already reached the country
out to survivors of the disaster mulet said
this is why think the presence of the american troops on the ground is going
to be very important and canadian troops also because they re the ones who will
be distributing this assistance he said
and what we need is cars and trucks and vehicles to reach the people
conditions remain grim for survivors in the capital although most of the bodies
which lay rotting for days on the streets in the chaotic aftermath of the quake
have now been collected and buried in mass graves
experts warn that hundreds of thousands of haitians will be living off foreign
aid and in temporary housing for years to come as rebuilding the nation may take
at least decade thousands have been left disabled
the united states canada france brazil and other donors meeting in montreal
will attempt to craft long term strategies to lift the crippled country the
poorest in the western hemisphere onto path to recovery

football algeria stun nations cup favourites ivory coast in thriller
cabinda angola jan afp
algeria clawed back from the brink of elimination to stun title favourites ivory
coast on sunday and reach the africa cup of nations semi finals
the winners fell behind on minutes to brilliant abdulkader keita goal
only for madjid bougherra to level in stoppage time and unmarked substitute
hamer bouazza headed nd minute far post winner
drama continued to the end with television replays suggesting late shot from
ivorian defender kolo toure that found the net was wrongly judged offside by an
assistant referee
victory for algeria sets up the prospect of last four showdown with bitter
rivals egypt who they deprived of place at the world cup in south africa
after play off
defending champons egypt face four time winners cameroon on monday in clash of
giants but the teams will struggle to match the drama of this encounter
ivory coast entered the second quarter final with far superior record than
algeria at this stage of the biennial african football showcase having won four
of five ties while their rivals lost all three
there was one enforced change in the ivorian elephants line up with guy demel
from german bundesliga outfit hamburg replacing suspended emmanuel eboue in the
back four
algeria introduced fit again defender antar yahia in place of ill abdelkader
laifaoui for his first appearance of the tournament and midfielder mourad meghni
took the place of bouazza
tradition favoured the elephants with two wins and draw from four previous
clashes with the desert foxes in match between countries with one nations
cup title each to their credit
as the match kicked off amid steamy evening conditions in this oil rich northern
angola enclave the chief concern of ivory coast coach vahid halilhodzic was
rustiness with their last match nine days ago
algeria had point to prove after accusations they and angola had fixed
goalless group draw in luanda to ensure both qualified at the expense of mali
but if the ivorians were rusty it did not show on four minutes as they reacted
quickest in goalmouth scramble and kalou struck the ball past goalkeeper
faouzi chaouchi to give the west africans perfect start
early attacking traffic was heading largely toward the goal of the white kit
algerians and rafik halliche was lucky to escape unpunished when he fouled
drogba inside the area and ivory coast should have been awarded penalty
algeria were gradually showing more confidence and coming at their opponents and
after coming close few times the north africans deservedly equalised as half
time approached
lofted pass toward the ivorian penalty area missed friend and foe and fell
invitingly for matmour from borussia moenchengladbach who left boubacar barry
helpless with shot that flew in off post
fascinating see saw struggle continued to offer scoring chances at each end
with drogba narrowly failing to reach kalou crossed and barry foiling matmour
when he broke through and had only the goalkeeper to beat
but the miss of the second half came five minutes from full time when kouassi
gervinho yao burst clear when bougherra failed to intercept pass only to
blaze over with just chaouchi to beat
in sensational climax to regulation time keita scored six minutes after
replacing kalou with candidate for goal of the tournament unleashing an
unstoppable shot from outside the area into the roof of the net
algeria refused to surrender however and unmarked defender bougherra was first
to cross on minutes and headed the ball down and up over barry to take
thriller into extra time

football nine man inter stun milan to go nine clear
milan jan afp
nine man inter milan moved nine points clear at the top of serie after
victory over arch rivals ac milan in pulsating derby at the san siro on
sunday
the champions played for more than an hour with numerical disadvantage after
wesley sneijder was sent off but they dominated throughout to earn richly
deserved victory
milan may still have game in hand on their neighbours but the psychological
effect of such crushing defeat will make the gap seem all the wider
milan may have come into the game as the form team in serie but inter were
clearly the more pumped up early on
sneijder almost fired them in front with moment of outrageous skill flicking
the ball up and thrashing yard volley that glanced off the outside of the
post
the dutch playmaker should then have given the hosts the lead as ricochet from
goran pandev shot fell into his path as he broke into the box but he rammed
his shot straight at goalkeeper dida
milan didn seem to heed those warnings and inter deservedly took the lead on
minutes as pandev ball over the top saw diego milito get behind ignazio
abate in the inside left channel and shoot low across dida and into the far
corner
inter were rampant and another break saw pandev feed milito on the inside right
but dida blocked his near post shot
inter were dominant and sneijder was running the show but the referee changed
that before the half hour was even up
inter centre back lucio burst forward into midfield and went down rather easily
under challenge but seeing that he still had the ball he got up and went to
carry on only for the referee to stop the game and book him for diving
inter were incensed and sneijder sarcastically applauded the referee an
offence usually meriting yellow card but he received red card though it
was unclear whether he had also verbally abused the referee
sneijder was beside himself and needed to be dragged from the field by two team
mates
inter knuckled down though with stalwarts javier zanetti and esteban cambiasso
looking to control the midfield
milan were disjointed and struggling to create anything with their best chance
coming from heavily deflected andrea pirlo free kick that wrong footed julio
cesar but looped up and landed on the roof of the net
milan came flying out in the second half and julio cesar saved close range
clarence seedorf header from david beckham corner before ronaldinho hit
swivelling volley just wide
inter were still dangerous on the counter and milito almost made milan pay with
one break but the visitors were gradually imposing themselves with beckham
crosses from the right causing particular bother as marco borriello headed one
just over
but then from another brilliant break milito slipped in pandev who chipped dida
only to see the ball come back off the post and into the brazilian grateful
arms
but on minutes giuseppe favalli brought down maicon on the edge of the box
and pandev stepped up to curl home free kick dida could do nothing about
tellingly it was only then that mourinho removed one of his forwards
milan disappointment for all but the beginning of the second half could only
muster wild pot shots from distance in the closing stages
in injury time lucio was dismissed for second booking as he gave away
penalty but julio cesar plunged to his right to beat out ronaldinho effort and
complete milan misery
earlier in the day napoli won at livorno to move to within point of third
placed as roma while palermo defeat of fiorentina moved them up to fifth

big blowout kind of show mean promote both of them owe it to them to
make the biggest possible show that translates to them the biggest amount of
money they can make and then we ll see who better
lopez gamboa could be as far off as in the meantime lopez could defend his
title in puerto rico and gamboa fight in miami
the featherweight ranks offer plenty of quality opponents including john the
wba super champion
the indonesian survived late scare but emerged with unanimous round
decision over american rocky juarez in las vegas last september
he remained unbeaten taking his record to victories with one drawn and
knockouts
ve got two horses and want them to wipe out everybody in the featherweight
division and when they finally meet people will go crazy arum said
gamboa olympic gold medallist for cuba improved to with wins
inside the distance with his second round knockout of tanzanian born rogers
mtagwa on saturday night
lopez improved to with knockouts with seventh round knockout of steven
luevano
don owe it to my two guys to build this into the biggest fight can arum
said it will be huge huge fight but not right now
gamboa said saturday he was ready to take on whoever arum puts in front of him
the tougher the better
love for whoever the public or maybe the press considers the number one
featherweight to have him in the ring for my next fight gamboa said that
way can show who is the best
