haiti quake toll to top minister
haitian police count their losses prepare for calamity
port au prince jan afp
police in the haitian capital counted their loses and gathered their forces
sunday preparing for surge in crime they are certain will follow the
devastating january earthquake
police leaders are still trying to determine how many officers can report for
work and how many police stations are still operational
looting is widespread in this city struggling to recover from the powerful
magnitude earthquake but police say they have yet to see wider rise in
violent crime
this hiatus is likely to be short lived the quake shattered the walls of the
city main prison granting freedom to some convicted criminals
police have doubled night patrols in cite soleil squalid port au prince slum
with population of one million people located next to the airport
they came back here we know but they are hiding in the alleys said chief
inspector rosemond aristide referring to gang leaders
there is no way to trap them right now said aristide the top official at
the cite soleil police station
in un peacekeepers supported police in cracking down on the cite soleil
crime lords and spent bullet from the fierce gun battles between the two sides
are still embedded in neighborhood walls
cite soleil police say they captured at least one escaped prisoner
fled the day of the earthquake was serving six month sentence in
arcahaie said richmon benedict naming prison in western haiti
surrendered because did not want to be on the lam right now benedict
said speaking from the cite soleil police station jail
an officer guarding him smiled and said the police version of the events was
different but gave no further details
looting an ongoing activity in downtown port au prince picked up sunday as
excavators removed large chunks of debris exposing both rotting cadavers and
valuables
in one downtown street the avenue of miracles police detained three looters
who were raiding pharmacy and forced them to the ground four other looters
fled with police in hot pursuit pistols drawn
come quickly the situation is degenerating police officer barked into his
radio calling for backup
we re not here to kill people said an officer who declined to give his name
the looters are everywhere
police eventually released the detained looters
what can do we have no jail the officer said
we patrol for hours but we can be everywhere said another police
officer with what little we have we aim to do the best possible
most people milling around on the street are looters they re waiting for us to
go try to understand they re desperate the officer said
looters accuse other looters to get rid of them thieves calling other
thieves thieves he said overwhelmed by the situation
just down the street police stood aside as looters descended upon wooden house
like locusts unable to contain the crowd
store manager thought they had lost everything in the quake she returned to
find that the damaged building could be accessed but looters had been there
first
it whole life gone said fernande derenoncourt my mother is the owner
she years of work gone of course we have no insurance
nevertheless police say that crime has not dramatically increased
we have not received an increase in crime reports at this time said the
police commissioner from the delmas sector carl henry boucher but afraid
that will change
whole families have camped out across the city with no more protection than
blanket women wash clothes in the middle of the street when water is available
even going to the delmas police station to file complaint is challenge
because the three story building housing the stationed collapsed eleven days
later they finished picking through the rubble for anything useful
the quake killed officers of the delmas force of and three have not
reported for duty eight jailed prisoners escaped boucher said
we will not rest until we re up and running again he said
two agents sitting at table amid the rubble are accepting complaints
when crime is reported they will go look for judge like they used to do
before the quake even though judges are now much harder to find

serious he said
we may be suffering from superiority complex that what disturbs us
sometimes as we say in nigeria too much confidence
zambia are well organised team with no one big individual star as such
physically we are taller and stronger but speaking of movement the zambians
are more agile
they run fast and lot and for tall players like us it could be difficult
we will try to keep compact but in general they will have more problems
against us than we will have against them
