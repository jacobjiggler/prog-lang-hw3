rugby union old foes munster and saints drawn together again
paris jan afp
two time champions munster and the team that beat them in the european cup
final northampton will be sick of the sight of each other after they were drawn
to play each other in the last eight of this year edition on sunday
saints lead the irish giants on head to head meetings the last victory
being in their first pool match this season but will be facing mammoth task
in trying to become only the second ever side after leicester to triumph at
munster thomond park fortress in the tournament history
munster edged them in the second pool clash in limerick on friday
french side biarritz may be struggling in the top domestic championship but
their european cup campaign carried on in triumphant fashion on sunday when they
ensured they hosted quarter final after beating scottish outfit glasgow
in their pool two clash
biarritz beaten by munster in the final joined defending
champions leinster and munster in being guaranteed home quarter final in
draw that features four french sides for the first time since the
edition
however their feat this time round is more impressive as back in
english clubs boycotted the tournament
this comes after they already faced each other in their pool this campaign with
northampton england sole survivor from the seven teams that started out
though two time champions leicester are appealing after ospreys had players
briefly on the pitch during their clash saturday winning their first match
biarritz areas in previous years when they have played at home in the last eight
to host the match against ospreys the only welsh side left in the competition
over the spanish border in san sebastian at the anoeta stadium
ospreys have reached their third successive quarter final but will be hoping to
reach the last four for the first time and keep alive hopes of becoming the
first welsh side to lift the trophy
so poor is the welsh record that cardiff are the only side to ever reach the
final and that was the inaugural one when they lost to toulouse
biarritz joint coach jack isaac said that he and his squad would not be taking
anything for granted against ospreys
only know the anoeta stadium from the basque derby match earlier this season
against bayonne said isaac
know it will be great occasion for our supporters to have party
it will be very complicated match against star studded side ospreys
hope that anoeta will help us be stronger than usual
leinster who played out nerve tingling draw with london irish on
saturday at twickenham which was enough to see northampton progress at the
latter expense will host clermont who will be real danger to the irish
side if they maintain their present form into april
three time champions toulouse displaced fellow french side clermont as the
fourth host when they beat english side sale later on sunday in their pool
five match
toulouse who have won six of the seven quarter finals they have hosted losing
just to leinster in will play fellow top side stade francais whose
unimpressive campaign in an uninspiring pool saw them still top the table
despite being beaten by edinburgh in their final match on saturday
we know stade francais they drew at our place in this season championship
and are extremely capable of beating us conceded toulouse manager guy
noves
and should we progress we will play either the champions leinster or the big
favourite for the competition clermont this is really tough draw for us
stade flamboyant president max guazzini who has yet to taste european glory
despite investing millions into the club was relieved to have ended drought
in terms of making the knockout stages
that is three years since we were last in the quarter finals therefore we have
no reason to complain about an away draw said guazzini
it not going to be easy toulouse are huge team as we saw in their win
over sale on sunday they have already previously won the european cup
we are at home to them at the stade de france on march in the championship
month before the european match that will be quite something
there are no italian sides in the last eight both viadana and treviso finished
bottom of their respective pools though the latter did beat french champions
perpignan in their first meeting
however once again the two best runners up spots in the quarter finals went to
sides in the italians pools which will inevitably lead to the debate about the
fairness of the qualifying rules being re opened
the matches are due to be played from april

football kroos fires leverkusen back to the top
berlin jan afp
rising star toni kroos was both chief playmaker and goalscorer on sunday in
leverkusen win over hoffenheim that knocked his parent club bayern munich
off the top of the table
kroos is on loan at leverkusen from bayern and the midfielder demonstrated what
his employers are missing by creating two goals and then scoring one of his own
in the second half his fifth in the last four league games
the germany under star who only turned earlier this month showcased the
class that has led bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge to insist he will be
returning to munich at the end of the season
but leverkusen boss jupp heynckes was unimpressed with his side first half
performance which saw hoffenheim go close on several occasions
we were careless and negligent after we went up said heynckes with his
side still unbeaten this season
said at the break that we must take the initiative and in the second half we
showed our class and showed why we are top of the league
after bayern beat werder bremen on saturday to temporarily take over at the
top of the table leverkusen win puts them back on top of the bundesliga with
two point advantage while bayern drop to second
leverkusen took the lead when kroos curled in free kick from the flanks and
defender sami hyypia slotted home from three metres out past hoffenheim
goalkeeper timo hildebrand after minutes
kroos then turned in cross from swiss striker eren derdiyok on minutes
before providing the final pass for tranquillo barnetta to slot home on
minutes and seal win that leaves hoffenheim ninth in the table
earlier bundesliga strugglers cologne earned their second win in three games
after inflicting shock defeat on defending champions wolfsburg who have
now gone seven league games without win
with striker lukas podolski missing with back injury cologne showed they can
do without their germany star and managed to defend for all they were worth to
hold on at the volkswagen arena and claim the three points
the defeat leaves wolfsburg coach armin veh under immense pressure and it
remains to be seen whether he will be in charge for their next game at hamburg
on friday
cologne took the lead when midfielder kevin pezzoni slipped his marker after
seven minutes to head home but wolfsburg fought back when christian gentner
levelled after only minutes
cologne striker sebastian freis then managed to hold off the challenge of two
defenders and the goalkeeper to slot his shot into the back of the net on
minutes
the home side responded immediately through portugal defender ricardo costa but
cologne were not to be denied only their fifth win of the season and on
minutes fries played adil chihi into space and he drilled his shot past
wolfsburg goalkeeper andre lenz
the result leaves wolfsburg th and cologne th but shouts of veh out will
not have been ignored by the wolves coach who is now looking in danger of
losing his job
an injury time goal from slovakia striker stanislav sestak robbed schalke of the
chance to go top as the royal blues were held by bochum
