football fuller sends arsenal crashing out of fa cup
london jan afp
arsenal became the latest member of the premier league elite to suffer an
early exit from the fa cup as ricardo fuller double strike inspired stoke
win over the gunners in the fourth round on sunday
manchester united humbled by league one leeds and liverpool shocked by
reading both perished in the third round and arsene wenger much changed side
were condemned to an equally chastening defeat at the britannia stadium
after claiming that arsenal remain vulnerable to physical opponents fuller
underlined his pre match jibe by heading the hosts into the lead after
seconds
the gunners defence including debutant sol campbell failed to deal with rory
delap trademark long throw and fuller nipped in front of hesitant goalkeeper
lukasz fabianski to head home from close range
wenger team drew level in the nd minute when denilson shot trickled past
thomas sorensen after deflecting off two stoke defenders
but fuller who had scored twice against arsenal last season proved thorn in
their side yet again in the th minute
mamady sidibe crossed from the right and the jamaican international escaped
campbell attentions to head past fabianski
dean whitehead ensured arsenal would suffer their first defeat in matches
when he turned in matthew etherington cross with four minutes to play
wenger insisted he had no regrets about his team selection as arsenal have so
many key league games coming soon
wanted to win this game and don regret the team picked did not have
much choice he said
if you look at our schedule it simply that you cannot always play with the
same eleven
if you rotate and you don win it your fault can only stand up and say
that the team that picked
in the day other game manchester city eased into the last with win
over championship strugglers scunthorpe at glanford park
city under strength side which nevertheless cost tens of millions more than
scunthorpe starting xi took the lead in the third minute when bulgaria
midfielder martin petrov smashed blistering strike past joe murphy
the underdogs hit back in the th minute when paul hayes took advantage of
debatable offside decision to volley home
nedem onouha restored city lead in first half stoppage time with low strike
after stephen ireland delicate chipped pass opened up the scunthorpe defence
veteran brazilian defender sylvinho seemed to have put city in complete control
when he launched fabulous long range effort past murphy in the th minute
scunthorpe refused to go quietly and city young defender dedryck boyata gave
them hope in the th minute when he deflected cliff byrne shot into his own
net
any hopes of replay were extinguished in the th minute when robinho ran onto
petrov pass and shot into the roof of the net to mark what could be the
unsettled brazilian final appearance for city
robinho has claimed over the weekend that city are prepared to let him join
brazilian club santos but eastlands boss roberto mancini asked if the star was
staying said think so because he an important player he scored good
goal
sylvinho added it difficult to know what going on robinho is good guy
and it was good contribution from him
believe he wants to stay because he loves manchester city and he enjoys
playing here he one of the best players in the world if he stays here it
will be good for us

fidel castro demands un say on us occupation of haiti
havana jan afp
retired cuban leader fidel castro on sunday called on the united nations to
assume monitoring role in haiti and he decried the us military occupation
of the quake ravaged caribbean country
castro in an opinion article published in the local newspapers said that
neither the united nations nor washington have given proper explanation of the
us military role in the wretchedly poor nation
amid the haitian tragedy with no one knowing how or why thousands of us
marines and paratroopers from the nd airborne division and other military
forces have occupied haitian territory even worse neither the united nations
nor the us government has offered an explanation of this movement of
forces castro wrote
castro said that the announcement of other countries to send more troops to
haiti will contribute to chaos and complicate the international cooperation
already complicated task
it is necessary to seriously discuss the issue and assign the united nations
the job of monitor that is its rightful role in this delicate situation
venezuelan president hugo chavez bolivia evo morales and nicaraguan leader
daniel ortega have all described the presence of some us soldiers in
haiti as an occupation
when the powerful magnitude quake struck haiti on january cuban doctors
were among the first foreign medical teams to arrive
cuba currently has team of doctors and paramedics operating in haiti
supported by haitians who studied medicine in cuba
castro said the cuban medics are carrying out strictly humanitarian task in
haiti and that cuba immediately agreed to us request to overfly cuban air
space in order to rush emergency supplies to haiti and evacuate the wounded
castro also noted that cuban supplies going through the us controlled airport at
port au prince have not had any difficulty in reaching its destination
also sunday government news reported that norway is donating dollars
worth of medicine and supplies for the cuban medical team operating in haiti
fidel castro left government in after succumbing to stomach ailment
ceding the presidency to his younger brother raul castro
football kroos fires leverkusen back to the top
berlin jan afp
rising star toni kroos was both chief playmaker and goalscorer on sunday in
leverkusen win over hoffenheim that knocked his parent club bayern munich
off the top of the table
kroos is on loan at levekusen from bayern and the midfielder demonstrated what
his employers are missing by creating two goals and then scoring one of his own
in the second half his fifth in the last four league games
the germany under star who only turned earlier this month showcased the
class that has led bayern chairman karl heinz rummenigge to insist he will be
returning to munich at the end of the season
after bayern beat werder bremen on sunday to temporarily take over the
table lead leverkusen win puts them back on top of the bundesliga with
two point advantage while bayern drop to second
leverkusen took the lead when kroos curled in free kick from the flanks and
defender sami hyypia slotted home from three metres out past hoffenheim
goalkeeper timo hildebrand after minutes
kroos then turned in cross from swiss striker eren derdiyok on minutes
before providing the final pass for tranquillo barnetta to slot home on
minutes and seal win that leaves hoffenheim ninth in the table
earlier bundesliga strugglers cologne earned their second win in three games
after inflicting shock defeat on defending champions wolfsburg who have
now gone seven league games without win
with striker lukas podolski missing with back injury cologne showed they can
do without their germany star and managed to defend for all they were worth to
hold on at the volkswagen arena and claim the three points
the defeat leaves wolfsburg coach armin veh under immense pressure and it
remains to be seen whether he will be in charge for their next game at hamburg
on friday
cologne took the lead when midfielder kevin pezzoni slipped his marker after
seven minutes to head home but wolfsburg fought back when christian gentner
levelled after only minutes
cologne striker sebastian freis then managed to hold off the challenge of two
defenders and the goalkeeper to slot his shot into the back of the net on
minutes
the home side responded immediately through portugal defender ricardo costa but
cologne were not to be denied only their fifth win of the season and on
minutes fries played adil chihi into space and he drilled his shot past
wolfsburg goalkeeper andre lenz
the result leaves wolfsburg th and cologne th but shouts of veh out will
not have been ignored by the wolves coach who is now looking in danger of
losing his job
bayern are second after their eighth consecutive win in all competitions and
their sixth in the bundesliga at bremen
goals by rising star thomas mueller and croatia striker ivica olic put bayern in
control before dutch star arjen robben unleashed direct free kick from
metres out which left bremen goalkeeper tim wiese with no chance
an injury time goal from slovakia striker stanislav sestak robbed schalke of the
chance to go top as the royal blues were held by bochum

port au prince jan afp

recovery teams began to bulldoze the capital devastated centre and french
ship carrying supplies arrived
twelve days after catastrophic earthquake razed much of the city hundreds of
thousands of haitians remained in desperate need of food water and shelter
despite large scale us military intervention and un run aid program
in port au prince morning prayers and song gave way to apocalyptic scenes as
earthmovers cleared downtown rubble spewing rotting corpses into the streets
and opening new routes for looters to swarm through the ruins
haitian police shouted out from time to time to deter the gangs but with little
conviction and less success we won do anything there nothing we can do
one of them said on rue du miracle
the police did shoot one young man however witnesses said he was treated at
the scene by the us troops now also patrolling the city looking for sites to
hand out humanitarian aid then taken away by ambulance
international donors meanwhile prepared to meet monday in montreal to discuss
rebuilding haiti after the quake which killed at least people in the
worst recorded disaster ever to hit the americas
in the skeletal shadow of port au prince shattered roman catholic cathedral
where the city archbishop was buried on saturday father glanda toussaint held
mass at an altar improvised on wooden table
before the january quake around people would fill the pews at the
cathedral when toussaint asked today congregation of around if they
understood why the disaster happened the crowd murmured their incomprehension
all is not the will of god but all is providential he said what we are
going through is not finished we must reconstruct the country and reconstruct
our faith as haitian it hurts
during the mass immediately behind the cathedral at least two rotting corpses
could be seen still trapped in the rubble of its collapsed wall
aid workers have been moving into the recovery phase after the government
officially called off search and rescue efforts but an international team on
saturday dug out year old wismond exantus from the ruins of shop
feel good exantus said in hospital survived by drinking coca cola
rescue teams have saved more than people from the wreckage of port au prince
since the magnitude quake
but there was tragic false alarm after college head received text message
from friend who was trapped and rescuers checked the area with dogs and radar
four times but found no signs of life
there was nothing it could be explained by the fact that the sms arrived late
like on new year day because there were so many calls french firefighter
christian morel said
on sunday french navy amphibious assault ship equipped with two landing craft
four helicopters and onboard operating theatres arrived in haitian waters to
offload tonnes of humanitarian aid
the crew of siroco tonne foudre class warship will spend four days
offloading aid and equipment for rescue teams including mechanical diggers to
clear the rubble left by thousands of ruined homes
the united states military has spearheaded aid efforts in haiti with
troops due to reach here by sunday france initially hit out after us forces
took over control of the main airport but tensions soon eased
vital aid was also slowly reaching devastated areas outside port au prince for
the first time including leogane the town at the epicentre of the earthquake
where around percent of all buildings were destroyed
the international organisation for migration which is leading efforts to
provide shelter for victims said sunday it had family sized tents ready
but that it needed total of
conditions remain grim for survivors in the capital although most of the bodies
which lay rotting for days on the streets in the chaotic aftermath of the quake
have now been collected and buried in mass graves
experts warn that hundreds of thousands of haitians will be living off foreign
aid and in temporary housing for years to come as rebuilding the nation may take
at least decade thousands have been left disabled
the united states canada france brazil and other donors meeting in montreal
will attempt to craft long term strategies to lift the crippled country the
poorest in the western hemisphere onto path to recovery
italy says haiti aid operations need leadership
rome jan afp
italy public safety chief sent to haiti to coordinate relief efforts on
sunday criticised lack of leadership in international aid operations
responding to the devastating quake
guido bertolaso who arrived in haiti on friday spoke on italian television
from the capital port au prince which was leveled in the january quake
describing terrible situation that could have been managed much better
he told the television channel raitre he hoped it is the last time the world
acts in this way
bertolaso who efficiently handled rescue operations after an earthquake in
aquila central italy last year met with haitian officials as well as those
leading the us and united nations aid operations
for bertolaso government minister it was logical the americans led relief
efforts given their major aid deployments in the country but too many
officers among them meant they had not been able to find capable leader
their action was impressive but it has not produced the results it could have
done if there had also been from the us will and capacity for coordination
and leadership he said
the americans should lead the aid operation but they need an emergency obama
that they have evidently not been able to find bertolaso added
given the slowness as bertolaso sees it of the international aid deployment
he warned against the risk of unrest from the haitian population that has
already gone beyond the limit of what is bearable
thought things would degenerate much earlier these people have great
dignity they are very patient and calm it is probably because they have
already suffered so many tragedies said bertolaso who trained as doctor
bertolaso said the un should allocate line of command and establish
unified structure so as to respond quickly and efficiently to major natural
disasters
he said he did not want to head this himself however saying he was too against
the grain
