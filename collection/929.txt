this was the first time in the competition that angola had fallen behind and
only fine goalline save from kingson denied them an equaliser on the half
hour
the danger arose when flavio zipped down the right crossing for manucho to head
home with the wigan stopper blocking the ball with his body
gyan had second goal disallowed on minutes when algerian referee mohammed
benouza hauled him up for offside
the flavio manucho show should have produced goal minute from the break but
kingson reflex save from close range and manucho poor miscue over the
woodwork saved ghana
angola coach manuel jose went into the interval scratching his head and fans
listened dubiously as from the stadium speakers the black eyed peas claimed
that tonight was going to be good night
angola midfielder job got warm welcome when he came on for stelvio before the
hour and his cross from the right shortly after his entrance almost led to the
leveller but manucho header from in front of goal went high
angola had virtually all the possession in the second half and were putting
together some slick attacking moves down both flanks yet ghana impressive
backline held firm time and time again
deep in injury time kali had only kingson to beat but he failed to make proper
contact and the loose ball slithering towards goal was cleared by hoffenheim

football palermo and napoli compound juve misery
milan jan afp
victories for palermo and napoli in serie on sunday compounded juventus loss
in falling at home to as roma the day before
juve eighth loss in matches ensured they failed to climb back into the top
four and with napoli win at livorno the turin giants now trail the
champions league places by four points
and with palermo cruising to home win over fiorentina juve dropped to
sixth as their miserable season in which they crashed out of the champions
league group stages in december continues to go from bad to worse
napoli th serie game without defeat coach walter mazzarri has not lost
league match since taking over from sacked former italy boss roberto donadoni in
october ensured they remain on course for top four finish
mazzarri praised his injury hit team but said they still have lot of improving
to do
proud of these players who are giving me so much satisfaction today we had
lot of players missing it was an important test he said
we re still bit naive and mawkish and we risk giving away points
and mazzarri insisted that he is most worried about palermo of the teams
challenging napoli for fourth
palmero are very good they re very strong team with coach delio rossi
for whom have lot of respect and they play good football
argentine forward german denis had goal ruled out for marginal offside
decision in the first half but the visitors still turned around at the break
goal to the good
that was thanks to stunning marco van basten style back post volley from
cristian maggio in first half injury time meeting luca cigarini cross with as
sweet strike as he has ever produced
livorno were awarded second half penalty for what television replays suggested
was clear dive as martin bergvold went down in the box three steps after the
lightest brush of contact with michele pazienza
however justice was done as cristiano lucarelli penalty was kicked away by
goalkeeper morgan de sanctis before the striker hurried follow up went both
high and wide
cigarini then curled home free kick in injury time after goalkeeper alfonso di
lucia was sent off for handling outside his area and defender davide marchini
had to go between the sticks as livorno had used up their three substitutes
in sicily palermo remained in the champions league hunt with thrashing of one
of their nearest rivals fiorentina
the champions league is still far off dream but we shall see haven done
much the praise should go to the players who believe in what we re doing said
rossi who took over from the sacked walter zenga in late november and has won
as many points in eight matches as his predecessor did in
young uruguayan striker abel hernandez opened the scoring heading home after
fabrizio miccoli shot crashed back off the bar
the year old then nutmegged french goalkeeper sebastien frey for his second
before igor budan volley sealed the victory in the second period
it could have been worse for juve as cagliari would also have overtaken them had
they won at rock bottom siena but they were held to draw in match both
teams finished with men
bologna came from behind to beat bari and move four points clear of the
relegation zone but lazio held at home to chievo and udinese beaten
at home by sampdoria both remain hovering precariously just above it
the big game of the day later in the evening is the eagerly anticipated derby
between the top two in serie inter and ac milan
football celtic run riot to close gap on leaders rangers
glasgow jan afp
celtic closed the gap on scottish premier league leaders rangers with win
over man st johnstone on sunday
tony mowbray side suffered an early shock at mcdiarmid park when liam craig
penalty put st johnstone ahead but the match turned celtic way when graham
gartland was sent off early in the second half
marc antoine fortune equalised for the glasgow club and georgios samaras put
them in front fortune added his second of the match before paddy mccourt late
goal sealed the rout
celtic victory was crucial after rangers were held to draw by hearts on
saturday and the hoops are now seven points behind rangers with game in hand
mowbray had players unavailable for the trip to perth and with lee naylor
injured during the midweek scottish cup win at morton teenage defender josh
thompson was handed his first start
the lack of familiarity among mowbray defence seemed to disturb celtic in the
opening stages and st johnstone who last beat the hoops back in took
shock lead in the th minute
celtic defender glenn loovens was the guilty party as he needlessly gave away
penalty by hauling down steven milne to prevent the striker reaching kenny
deuchar pass
referee william collum pointed to the spot and craig stepped up to send artur
boruc the wrong way
celtic responded quickly and moments later chinese midfielder zheng zhi shot
was cleared off the line by jody morris
loovens dismal day was completed when he was forced off midway through the
first half after clashing heads with deuchar
mistake by gartland that gifted chance to niall mcginn failed to spark
celtic into life and the midfielder shot tamely at graeme smith from close
range
mowbray would have demanded more from his players at half time and got an
immediate response just seconds after the restart gartland was shown straight
red card for desperate last ditch tackle on fortune just outside the penalty
area
prompted by aidan mcgeady in midfield celtic finally began to threaten and
would have been level but for poor finishing from greek striker samaras
he mis kicked mcginn cutback then hit the outside of post from yards
after being set up by fortune
but celtic pressure finally told as fortune fired superb strike past the
smith from the edge of the penalty area in the th minute
st johnstone had nothing left to give in the final stages as celtic made the
most of their extra man
samaras broke their resolve in the th minute when he pounced on thompson
header and drove perfectly struck shot past smith
smith was under siege now and in the st minute the st johnstone keeper could
only parry mccourt long range drive to fortune who sent the rebound back past
the keeper and into the far corner
mccourt rubbed salt into st johnstone wounds in the th minute when he
finished off typically incisive run with fine finish

paris jan afp
two time champions munster and the team that beat them in the european cup
final northampton will be sick of the sight of each other after they were drawn
to play each other in the last eight of this year edition on sunday
saints lead the irish giants on head to head meetings the last victory
being in their first pool match this season but will be facing mammoth task
in trying to become only the second ever side after leicester to triumph at
munster thomond park fortress in the tournament history
munster edged them in the second pool clash in limerick on friday
french side biarritz may be struggling in the top domestic championship but
their european cup campaign carried on in triumphant fashion on sunday when they
ensured they hosted quarter final after beating scottish outfit glasgow
in their pool two clash
biarritz beaten by munster in the final joined defending
champions leinster and munster in being guaranteed home quarter final in
draw that features four french sides for the first time since the
edition
however their feat this time round is more impressive as back in
english clubs boycotted the tournament
this comes after they already faced each other in their pool this campaign with
northampton england sole survivor from the seven teams that started out
though two time champions leicester are appealing after ospreys had players
briefly on the pitch during their clash saturday winning their first match
biarritz are likely as in previous years when they have played at home in the
last eight to host the match against ospreys the only welsh side left in the
competition over the spanish border in san sebastian
ospreys have reached their third successive quarter final but will be hoping to
reach the last four for the first time and keep alive hopes of becoming the
first welsh side to lift the trophy
so poor is the welsh record that cardiff are the only side to ever reach the
final and that was the inaugural one when they lost to toulouse
leinster who played out nerve tingling draw with london irish on
saturday at twickenham which was enough to see northampton progress at the
latter expense will host clermont who will be real danger to the irish
side if they maintain their present form into april
three time champions toulouse displaced fellow french side clermont as the
fourth host when they beat english side sale later on sunday in their pool
five match
toulouse who have won six of the seven quarter finals they have hosted losing
just to leinster in will play fellow top side stade francais whose
unimpressive campaign in an uninspiring pool saw them still top the table
despite being beaten by edinburgh in their final match on saturday
against stade francais anything can happen admitted toulouse former all
black scrum half byron kelleher
but playing at home for us is an important factor
there are no italian sides in the last eight both viadana and treviso finished
bottom of their respective pools though the latter did beat french champions
perpignan in their first meeting
however once again the two best runners up spots in the quarter finals went to
sides in the italians pools which will inevitably lead to the debate about the
fairness of the qualifying rules being re opened
the matches are due to be played from april
us envoy in peace shuttle between israelis palestinians
amman jan afp
us middle east envoy george mitchell on sunday shuttled between jerusalem and
amman in his second attempt this week to persuade israeli and palestinian
leaders to relaunch peace talks
mitchell met israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in jerusalem before
heading to amman to see palestinian president mahmud abbas as part of tour
aimed at reviving talks suspended during the gaza war more than year ago
president barack obama secretary of state hillary clinton and the united
states are fully committed to comprehensive peace in the middle east
mitchell said after meeting abbas in joint remarks to reporters with chief
palestinian negotiator saeb erakat
the two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict which includes the
creation of an independent and viable palestinian state we believe it the
only realistic solution to the conflict
he said that such solution also includes agreements between israel and syria
israel and lebanon and full normalisation of relations among all countries in
the region
mitchell said washington would pursue our efforts until that objective is
achieved
erakat said the palestinians have not set preconditions for resumption of
talks
we don have any conditions to resume negotiations it time for israel to
drop its conditions he said if israel thinks that by finger pointing at us
and blaming us the conflict can be solved it won be solved
what really obstructs the efforts by senator mitchell and president obama is
israel and its settlements incursions and assassinations when we say israel
should stop building settlements it not palestinian condition it an
israeli commitment that should be respected erakat said
we want credible peace and we will continue to do our best and cooperate with
the united states but israel should respect its commitments
earlier in jerusalem netanyahu said after meeting mitchell that the envoy had
presented new ideas about how to relaunch the peace process without
elaborating
expressed my hope that these new ideas will lead to the renewal of the peace
process if the palestinians themselves show similar interest he added
the united states has been trying for months to convince both sides to return to
the negotiating table but the palestinians have refused to do so unless israel
halts all settlement growth in the west bank and east jerusalem territories it
occupied in
washington initially backed that demand but has more recently pressed both sides
to return to the talks immediately and praised limited month settlement
slowdown enacted by netanyahu in november
the palestinians have rejected the moratorium on building starts because it
excludes mostly arab east jerusalem which they demand as their capital as
well as public buildings and projects already under way
after meeting mitchell netanyahu attended symbolic tree planting ceremony at
gush etzion major west bank settlement bloc that israel plans to keep in any
future peace deal
our message is clear we are planting trees here we will remain here we will
build here this place will remain part of israel for ever there is national
consensus on this issue his office quoted him as saying
israel has insisted it will not give any more ground and has blamed the
palestinians for the impasse
vice prime minister silvan shalom said on sunday it was time to say clearly and
unequivocally that there will be no further concessions from israel for the
launching of negotiations
the method of the palestinians is to refuse to resume negotiations to force the
united states to exert pressure on israel he told public radio the ball is
in the palestinian court
mitchell held first round of talks with netanyahu on thursday and met abbas on
friday last week he also visited lebanon and syria
later on sunday he flew to cairo for two day visit during which he would meet
officials egypt official mena news agency reported without elaborating

influential buddhist pleads for religious freedom in vietnam
hanoi jan afp
one of the world most influential buddhist monks made plea for religious
freedom in vietnam monday after his followers were forced from two temples
devotees of french based zen master and peace activist thich nhat hanh say they
have gone underground in vietnam since last month when they were driven from the
phuoc hue temple where they sought refuge after an earlier eviction
nhat hanh said hired mobs were used last september to force hundreds of the
young monks and nuns from bat nha monastery in central vietnam where they had
meditated and lived peacefully for several years
all we want is to practise why can we he asked in his eight page plea
written in the form of koan type of zen riddle
why is it that in other countries people can practise this tradition freely
and we can
nhat hanh who was confidant of slain us civil rights leader martin luther
king is based at the plum village monastery in france
the people deep wish is for every citizen to be able to speak his or her mind
without fear of denunciation or arrest he wrote the people deep wish is to
separate religion from political affairs and take the politics out of
religion
all religious activity in vietnam remains under the control of the communist
state which says it always respects freedom of belief and religion authorities
have denied driving out the plum village devotees and described the issue as an
internal dispute among buddhist factions
buddhism demands freedom freedom of thought is the basic condition for
progress nhat hanh wrote
he called the expulsion an ugly stain on the history of buddhism in vietnam
where he said kings and politicians centuries ago followed virtuous buddhist
path in contrast to officials caught up in corruption and other vices today
nhat hanh asked whether communist officials were afraid that if his followers
have mass support it would be at the officials expense
both the us embassy and the european parliament have expressed concern over the
expulsion

climate talks threaten saudi with anti oil bias official
riyadh jan afp
global climate talks are biased against oil and pose scary threat to saudi
arabia economy top official said on sunday defending riyadh stance on
efforts to harness greenhouse gas emissions
mohammed al sabban the country top climate negotiator said negotiations on
emissions controls saw saudi arabia for decades the world leading oil
exporter effectively targeted by certain industrialised countries while
letting their own subsidized coal nuclear and biofuel industries off the hook
he also said that after the watered down resolutions at the december un climate
change conference in copenhagen climate negotiations were deadlocked
there was no real agreement in copenhagen and don foresee any agreement in
the near term sabban told afp in an interview
no one has submitted burden sharing agreement that treats various parties
equitably he said
we are facing the same deadlock as the doha round of the wto the world trade
organisation he said of long stuck global trade agreement negotiations
environmentalists at the copenhagen summit last month labelled saudi arabia and
china the culprits that prevented strong agreement obliging countries to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions
ahead of the conference sabban and oil minister ali naimi said that saudi
arabia which depends on oil revenues for about percent of government
spending should be compensated for losses caused by any pact that forced
sharp reduction in global oil consumption
environmentalists mocked their argument but it reflected deep saudi concern
over anti oil bias in the proposed emissions controls sabban said on sunday on
the sidelines of the global competitiveness forum in riyadh
he said the proposals did not equally address coal nuclear biofuel and other
energy sources that also generate harmful emissions and other problems but were
protected by their home countries
if any energy product should be hit hard it should be coal he said
he also explained riyadh criticisms of energy independence drives in countries
like the united states which he labelled phobia
such programmes together with strong controls on emissions from burning
petroleum would deal devastating blow to the saudi economy
if all countries take steps to reduce dependency then definitely this will
impact the demand for oil that is very scary for us he said
sabban cited research from the international energy agency which forecast
loss of four trillion dollars in potential oil sales by opec countries during
if aggressive carbon emissions reduction targets were implemented
but the same study still says that overall opec income will increase sharply
over the previous year period
economists say the saudis are particularly worried about the mixed signals they
