even now said sabban riyadh is being encouraged to sustain investment in oil
to support the global economy
if there is continued need for increasing investment and at the same time
they are saying we don want your oil that contradiction said the us
trained economist
he admitted that climate change was already hurting his mostly parched desert
country as it was others with higher temperatures falling water tables and
surge in violent sandstorms and flash floods
sabban said riyadh supports an equitable climate pact but not what had been
laid out so far
we are going to be impacted by both climate change and the response measures

he said saudi arabia was investing heavily in solar energy hoping eventually to

enriched uranium of percent purity being sent to russia and france in one
batch for further enrichment to percent and then returned as fuel for
tehran research reactor
enriched uranium of percent purity is used as fuel to power nuclear reactors
and iran needs it for its internationally monitored tehran facility
iranian officials however have offered counter proposal of phased fuel
swap and foreign minister manouchehr mottaki gave the west an end january
deadline to accept the iranian plan
world powers led by washington are against iran enriching uranium as it can also
used to make the fissile core of nuclear bomb
the west suspect iran wants enriched uranium despite three sets of un
sanctions so that it can make atomic weapons tehran says its nuclear
programme is aimed solely at generating electricity
western powers have indicated that iran has effectively rejected the un brokered
proposal put forward in vienna talks hosted by the international atomic energy
agency the un nuclear watchdog

would start up this year
all the work is going as scheduled the tests are success this year will be

against iran over its controversial nuclear programme
earlier this week russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said moscow does
regret iran refusal to accept the un brokered fuel plan
he noted that the un security council had the capacity to study further
measures on iran but did not come out explicitly in support of further
sanctions
acting with logic of punishing iran is not sober approach he said
gholam ali haddad adel an influential iranian lawmaker with close ties to
supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei reiterated on sunday that tehran will not

it asks president barack obama to report in six months on anti american
