saudi sees deadlock in climate talks
riyadh jan afp
saudi arabia does not expect any global climate change pact soon because current
proposals lack fair burden sharing and would hit oil exporters unfairly the
country top climate negotiator said on sunday
there was no real agreement in copenhagen and don foresee any agreement in
the near term mohammed al sabban told afp referring to december summit in
the danish capital
no one has submitted burden sharing agreement that treats various parties
equitably he said
we are facing the same deadlock as the doha round of the wto the world trade
organisation he said of long stuck global trade agreement negotiations
sabban said saudi arabia cast by environmentalists together with china as
spoiler of the copenhagen climate treaty talks would have been hit hard by the
proposed agreements on limiting greenhouse gas emissions
he said the proposed rules and targets were very selective unfairly singling
out oil while favouring coal nuclear and other energy sources which also
contribute to global warming
sabban also said he did not expect the differences in talks could be bridged by
the next summit which is planned for mexico in december
oil exports are by far the largest source of government income in saudi arabia
after russia the world largest oil exporter
if any energy product should be hit hard it should be coal he said adding
that some major developed economies heavily subsidize coal

football extra police drafted in for manchester derby
london jan afp
extra police will be on duty for wednesday potentially explosive league cup
semi final between bitter rivals manchester united and manchester city amid
fears the tie could turn ugly
city won the first leg at eastlands but the clash was marred by fighting in
and outside eastlands which led police to make arrests
furious verbal spat between city striker carlos tevez and united defender gary
neville which saw both players gesture at each other during the game has
raised the temperature even further
tevez described neville as boot licker and moron after the match and
with city fans set to make the short trip across manchester police are
taking no chance
an additional police will be on duty and spot checks will be made at pubs
around the ground in what is described as the highest risk game at old
trafford this season
ian hopkins assistant chief constable of greater manchester police revealed
talks would take place tomorrow with united and city officials and the football
association in bid to prevent any trouble
he told bbc radio five live sportsweek will be meeting with both the clubs
again along with the fa to discuss the general crowd behaviour and making sure
that they understand their responsibility not to do anything that likely to
incite the crowd
we will be making the points very strongly that the players are professionals
they need to recognise the impact they can have on the crowd and it going to
be really passionate again on wednesday there lot at stake for both teams
and for the fans
meanwhile tevez agent kia joorabchian has admitted neville claims that
united boss sir alex ferguson was right not to keep the argentine when he was on
loan at old trafford could lead to another flash point in the second leg
joorabchian told sportweek carlos played two years at manchester united and he
has very good relationships with lot of the players he admires and likes
wayne rooney and patrice evra and ryan giggs and he considers lot of them
friends of his
don think he will expect to have any atmosphere in relation to the players
but guess he and gary neville are not going to be very good friends any time
shortly
if you don have respect and class you have to accept that they are entitled
to say something back gary neville stepped into something that maybe he
shouldn have done and since he didn have that respect carlos felt he had to
