us marines in haiti move full speed ahead
leogane haiti jan afp
surrounded by sugar cane plantation and herds of emaciated cows about
hundred us marines secure the perimeter of new heliport set up just in the
middle of haitian plain
the heliport is designed to receive humanitarian aid but one marine officer
complains it takes too much time for the packages to leave the area
sitting on pile of food rations lieutenant michael fee explains how the aid
distribution system works
us marines offload relief supplies and secure the area and then give the aid to
the united nations he says non governmental organizations then take charge of
aid delivery while the united nations and canadians secure its distribution
it web of people to get the aid out fee complains it is too
complicated that why there is this backlog
meanwhile time in leogane is of the essence located about kilometers
miles from the capital of port au prince the town was right in the epicenter
of the january earthquake and percent of its buildings were left in
ruins
and while the bulk of international aid is directed toward port au prince us
marines have decided to focus their rescue efforts on this community straddling
an important road leading south
few dozen famished haitians lurk around the guarded heliport eyeing with envy
containers with water and packages with food stamped usa
but it is impossible to organize food distribution here explains lieutenant
fee
all we found to land is this area he says if we were organizing
distribution here the landing zone would be crowded and it would stop the air
flow people have been very understanding given the amount of aid that sitting
in front of them
interpreters hired by the us military try to explain to the curious that food
will be distributed to people just in different location
some marines feel sorry not to be able to distribute the supplies themselves
but there are reasons behind this order
if give woman bottle of water and guy shows up and hits her can
engage him or detain him argues corporal nicolas hefley don have the
right to
un truck appears at about am speaking broken english blue helmets
from sri lanka try to understand why they have to begin their distribution with
water purification tablets
people here are poor not educated they don understand how to use this they
can read argues chief petty officer bandara nuwan galath of the sri lankan
navy who serves here as part of un stabilization force all they want is
food and water
but this attitude makes us gunnery sergeant joshua wruble veteran of three
tours of duty in afghanistan impatient
am telling you to take these tablets do you understand he snarls at the un
troops
the sergeant says he appreciates the opportunity to help haitians in need but
admits that humanitarian missions are not exactly his forte
you definitely have to transition your mindset he explains you have to take
it from one extreme to the other from combat thrill to compassion
wruble is no stranger to haiti he first came to the country in when then
us president bill clinton ordered us marines to land there to restore in power
president jean bertrand aristide toppled by military coup
we are here every three to four years he points out the haitian population
has an intimate knowledge of what the marines are about they respond well to
us
un troops finish distributing us relief supplies to nearby orphanage in the
afternoon once the mission is over few boxes remain in the back of the
truck these are water purification tablets
separately in port au prince un troops on saturday fired warning shots and
sprayed tear gas on quake survivors after food delivery to hundreds of them
spiraled out of control in the capital
spokeswoman for the un organisation for the coordination of humanitarian
affairs ocha at its operations centre in geneva said the incident appeared to
be isolated with little violence reported in haiti
it normal that there would be such isolated incidents due to exasperation and
despair the spokeswoman elisabeth byrs told afp
such violence is not representative of the haitian people the population has
been calm and dignified in the wake of the quake byrs said

sunday
henin won tough battle against her year old countrywoman in yet another
long contest the year old third marathon in row

physically it tough as didn play for two years but love being back on
court

thai and cambodian troops clash by disputed border military
preah vihear cambodia jan afp
cambodian and thai troops exchanged fire near disputed border temple sunday
the latest in string of gun battles between the countries since last year
military officials said
both sides denied responsibility for starting the morning skirmish in which
nobody was wounded but rifles and rockets were fired for around minutes
there was small clash they entered our territory cambodian deputy military
commander chea dara told afp claiming that the thai side were the first to open
fire
it was cambodian self defence we don allow anyone to invade our territory
he added
thai army official asking not to be named said the clash stemmed from
confusion when thailand soldiers were patrolling for illegal loggers near the
border
the thai army understood the cambodians were smugglers while cambodian troops
opened fire however it was only warning fire it came from
misunderstanding everything is now clear he said
the battle took place kilometres southeast of the th century preah vihear
temple during speech there by cambodian foreign minister hor namhong in which
he urged troops to be brave defending their territory
the government position is that we want to solve the problem bilaterally and
peacefully he said
but he added we are ready to solve the problem through negotiations and with
any other means even through the military we have enough weapons we are not
afraid
cambodia and thailand have been at loggerheads over the land around preah vihear
for decades but nationalist tensions spilled over into violence in july
when the temple was granted unesco world heritage status
gun battle near the temple area last april left three people dead
the world court ruled in that the temple belonged to cambodia but the
border between the two nations has never been fully demarcated partly because
it is littered with landmines left over from decades of war in cambodia
relations between the two countries plunged further in november after cambodian
pm hun sen appointed ousted former thai premier thaksin shinawatra who lives
abroad to escape jail term for corruption as an economic adviser

step following media report that al qaeda is training female suicide bombers
and india decision to warn airlines about possible hijack attempt
but miliband spoke of the threat posed by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula
aqap operating in yemen
