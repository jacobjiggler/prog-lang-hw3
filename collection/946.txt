inference being that the genocide in which some people essentially
minority tutsis were killed happened the time he failed to return home to
sleep
jacqueline played by ruth nirere hitherto unknown rwandan actress who won
several awards for the role finds her two children slaughtered on the living
room floor in the first days of the genocide as she attempts to wash the bodies
she is chased out by neighbours who want to lynch her
she watches from distance as an old woman intent on occupying the house
drags the children bodies out onto the street and then sweeps the ground
matter of factly
then begins life of hiding in the forest living like an animal along with
another survivor whose wounds she treats and whose name we never learn
periodically hutu militia hear them in the undergrowth and give chase boasting
of those they have already raped and killed
jacqueline already mad with grief from the loss of her children is pushed over
the brink by the sound of the machete her new companion uses to chop bamboo and
attempts to use the machete to kill him
the film ends with her running back to her village towards the end of the
genocide and collapsing in the street surrounded by her former neighbours who
debate whether they should help her recover kill her or just let her die
the film van leeuw first has minimal dialogue partly in kinyarwanda and
partly in french much of it composed as the actors went along
this film shows more or less all the events of the genocide betrayal by the
neighbour manhunts the anxiety in the hiding places and then there is also
this will to survive theodore simburudali who heads the genocide survivors
association ibuka told afp after watching the film
outside of rwanda the film is unlikely to make it onto mainstream screens many
spectators at thursday avant premiere for officials and diplomats could be
seen averting their eyes from the screen during the most harrowing scenes
at the premiere friday two women walked out unable to stand the scene where
jacqueline finds her children dead
it reminds me of what happened it does bring back emotions yes but we
survivors lived through worse things than that subsistence farmer who
identified herself only as mrs uwamahoro told afp
she spent the three months of the genocide hiding in the mud in the swamps of
bugesera eating only papyrus leaves
jeanne dusabe hutu friend accompanying her to the screening said she thought
the film was very good and possibly powerful enough to convince some
negationists that the genocide did indeed take place
over the past eight years several feature films have been made about the rwandan
genocide among them the controversial hotel rwanda by irish director terry
george shooting dogs released in the us as beyond the gates by michael
caton jones sometimes in april by haitian director raoul peck and
days low budget feature directed by nick hughes

down under
evans two time runner up in france had not expected to figure strongly in
adelaide but he shot up the standings with third place finish in searing heat
on day three and daring break on stage five
didn come here with any expectations because putting pressure on yourself
to perform when you haven done the preparation isn healthy he said
hopefully it sign of things to come
evans finished behind german winner andre greipel but ahead of tour of spain
title holder alejandro valverde who is appealing doping conviction and tour
de france champions lance armstrong and oscar pereiro
he said he was gearing his season around may giro where he briefly wore the
pink leader jersey during his last appearance in and another tilt at the
tour de france in july
there unfinished business at the giro and tour de france for me and that
been years of culminating and whetting my appetite he said
evans appeared here with new team bmc and as the first australian to wear the
road race world champion distinctive rainbow jersey
didn know what effect the rainbow jersey had on people within cycling
because never had one he said
it really does have pretty amazing effect it certainly stands out in the
peloton just want to honour the rainbow jersey for what it is

world championships head to melbourne saying the course did not fit well with
his riding style

lent before carnival in quake stricken haiti
port au prince jan afp
there will be no carnival celebration this year in the quake ravaged haitian
capital and perhaps never again for people like hored stanley who lost
fellow musicians the day the earthquake struck
stanley was at carnival planning event at downtown school when the
massive quake struck on january he was initially trapped when the building
collapsed but rescued by neighbors screamed and cried out until they pulled
me out he told afp
stanley spoke near the pile of rubble where the school once stood located on
center street in the heart of downtown port au prince
at least three blackened skulls and human bones could be seen amid the debris
rotting corpse stuck out of the debris in the school courtyard now filled with
rubble with pictures and flyers of school notices fluttering around it
garbage set ablaze because no one was available to clean it up smoldered in
the background
the same neighbors that saved stanley pulled out bodies using only their bare
hands over the next days there are at least people trapped in there one
of the neighbors said
whole families were wiped out when the magnitude quake struck razing much
of the haitian capital and killed more than people with relatives dead
or unable to claim bodies center street neighbors reached an agonizing
collective decision on the fate of the corpses
we decided to burn them stanley said nobody came to pick them up and the
stench was terrible
stanley reluctantly helped set the bodies on fire and said he will have the
event etched in his memory forever
we are alive but it as if we were dead he said his bright eyes set in
fixed stare
we were holding meeting to prepare for carnival when the quake struck he
said he then mutters for me carnival is over forever
carnival held mainly in catholic countries and characterized by dancing music
and colorful street parades is usually celebrated in january and february the
event precedes lent period of prayer and abstinence ahead of easter when
christians celebrate the resurrection of jesus
easter this year is april the government however has decreed days of
mourning which ends around the time lent begins
hertha bien aime lost year old son who was at the carnival planning event
as well as two granddaughters and an aunt however she hopes to celebrate
carnival next year
and why not what else do we have left here she asked shrugging
center street neighbors cannot recall any similar disaster since the music group
was formed years ago
the names of people who died and whose bodies were recovered from the school are
scrawled on nearby wall farewell maxo tiflanne edna beatrice jocelyn
tipapy thomas richmon jean eli sampase taina alvin it reads
refugees are now squatting inside the buses and vehicles parked outside the
national stadium that were going to join the carnival parade the new occupants
hang their clothes cook on the ground and wait for someone to tell them what is
going to happen with their lives
one of the colorful cars is emblazoned with the name of its owner dj cash cash
dj cash cash is my friend said haitian woman named valerie jeanlouis as
she washed her clothes asked him if could move here and he agreed
jeanlouis lives in santo domingo with her family but was visiting port au
prince when the quake struck her year old daughter has cracked skull and
is in the hospital
now have to stay here can move she said she isn even sure that she
can find work as maid again once she returns to the dominican republic
creole speaking haiti and the spanish speaking dominican republic share the
island of hispaniola
carnival would have been fun yes she smiles nostalgically carnival in my
country is the best in the world but now we ll have to wait
on saturday haitians prayed and danced to the rhythm of drums during the first
official religious service that was organized in the center of port au prince
since the january earthquake which killed at least people
pastor andre muscadin said prayers were offered to chase away the spirits some
haitians believe were transported to their country from africa along with
slaves and also to offer repentance and seek forgiveness for the violence that
has been committed throughout the country troubled past
us envoy shares new ideas in second meeting with israel pm
jerusalem jan afp
us middle east envoy george mitchell on sunday shared new ideas with israeli
prime minister benjamin netanyahu on renewing peace talks with the palestinians
the premier said
heard few interesting ideas in order to renew the peace process netanyahu
said at the start of weekly cabinet meeting after holding talks with mitchell
for second time on the envoy latest regional tour
expressed my hope that these new ideas will lead to the renewal of the peace
process if the palestinians themselves show similar interest he added without
providing any further details
mitchell was also due to meet palestinian president mahmud abbas for second
time later in the day in amman after having held inconclusive meetings with
both leaders last week
the united states has been trying for months to convince both sides to return to
the negotiating table but the palestinians have refused to do so unless israel
halts all settlement growth in the west bank and east jerusalem territories it
occupied in
washington initially backed that demand but has more recently pressed both sides
to immediately return to the talks and praised limited month settlement
slowdown enacted by netanyahu in november
the palestinians have rejected the moratorium on building starts because it
excludes mostly arab east jerusalem which they demand as their capital as
well as public buildings and projects already under way
israel has meanwhile insisted it will not give any more ground and blamed the
palestinians for the impasse
israel vice prime minister silvan shalom on sunday said it was time to say
clearly and unequivocally that there will be no further concessions from israel
for the launching of negotiations
the method of the palestinians is to refuse to resume negotiations to force the
united states to exert pressure on israel he told public radio
the ball is in the palestinian court
son of escobar wrestling with sins of father
park city utah jan afp
the anguished son of colombian drug lord pablo escobar has reached out to the
victims of his murderous father in compelling documentary being screened at
the sundance film festival
over the years sebastian marroquin formerly juan pablo escobar has
rejected dozens of offers from hollywood to help tell the story of his notorious
late father gunned down by police in
but marroquin who changed his name and relocated to buenos aires to start new
life has finally spoken out in sins of my father nicolas entel powerful
entry to sundance world documentary competition
producer friend in colombia suggested making documentary about pablo
escobar argentine film maker entel told afp
was looking to do something new from different point of view and it was
then that had the idea of telling the story through escobar only son
spent six months trying to convince him to take part he had already turned
down more than offers because most of them wanted to exploit the name escobar
and glamorize the life of gangster
juan pablo escobar was when he decided shortly after the bloody death of
his father to change his name and move to argentina with his mother
now something architect marroquin appears in the film as tormented soul
torn between feeling love for the man he once knew as his father and disgust at
the horrific crimes he committed which included ordering the murders of several
thousand people according to some estimates
if marroquin appears calm it because he has lost the right to be angry
entel told afp
if you play dirty trick on me and say going to kill you you know
it figure of speech entel said if sebastian says something like that
then he knows that tomorrow the newspapers are going to say that the son of
pablo escobar threatened to kill someone
entel documentary follows marroquin as he attempts to seek reconciliation with
the children of rodrigo lara bonilla colombia former justice minister and
luis carlos galan presidential candidate both of whom were murdered at the
behest of escobar
the scene where marroquin comes fact to face with the children of his father
victims is the documentary most powerful moment
for me it was very important to concentrate on the children on the new
generation entel said
haitian slums set to expand after quake
port au prince jan afp
skinning the occasional cat for food and still living on the street many
residents of the devastated haitian capital are building new homes with strips
of wood and rusty pieces of metal
their work is set to multiply port au prince already sprawling slums
transforming makeshift refugee camps across sports grounds and wasteland
at the far end of spread of sheets and string in the parc la paix sports

structures
each person builds his own house said year old pierre felio hammering
wooden frame
we picked up the materials in the street my house isn finished yet but
sleep on mattress here for now
several naked people washed with buckets of soapy water in corner of former
bleachers as the camp stretched out across the dusty field
many inhabitants said they previously lived in stone houses in an area nearby
but those collapsed when the strength quake shook large parts of the
caribbean nation
in another corner of the stadium year old nichama theodor tidied the inside
of roofless shack as her five year old daughter played by her side
we have to get it finished before it starts raining theodor said after the
un warned that the rainy season was about to begin potentially causing further
problems for survivors
don know how we ll keep going because have no money added the fluent
french speaker who said she wanted to become nurse
elsewhere in the camp many concentrated on basic necessities
two men skinned cat next to one tent preparing to feed it to their families
we have nothing at all said one of their wives guillaulaine elly
sitting on the ground next to her two daughters
but we don want to leave the capital our family is here
as the assistance effort gained pace in parts of port au prince and the worst
affected towns of jacmel and leogane huge relocation of survivors out of the
capital was underway
around one million people were left homeless amid the rubble the interior
ministry has estimated
but residents at the stadium and also nearby site where corrugated iron
structures were springing up said they had no desire to leave port au prince
despite not yet having received food or water from numerous foreign aid groups
here

us marines in haiti move full speed ahead
leogane haiti jan afp
surrounded by sugar cane plantation and herds of emaciated cows about
hundred us marines secure the perimeter of new heliport set up just in the
middle of haitian plain
the heliport is designed to receive humanitarian aid but one marine officer
complains it takes too much time for the packages to leave the area
sitting on pile of food rations lieutenant michael fee explains how the aid
distribution system works
us marines offload relief supplies and secure the area and then give the aid to
the united nations he says non governmental organizations then take charge of
aid delivery while the united nations and canadians secure its distribution
it web of people to get the aid out fee complains it is too
complicated that why there is this backlog
meanwhile time in leogane is of the essence located about kilometers
miles from the capital of port au prince the town was right in the epicenter
of the january earthquake and percent of its buildings were left in
ruins
and while the bulk of international aid is directed toward port au prince us
marines have decided to focus their rescue efforts on this community straddling
an important road leading south
few dozen famished haitians lurk around the guarded heliport eyeing with envy
containers with water and packages with food stamped usa
but it is impossible to organize food distribution here explains lieutenant
fee
all we found to land is this area he says if we were organizing
distribution here the landing zone would be crowded and it would stop the air
flow people have been very understanding given the amount of aid that sitting
in front of them
interpreters hired by the us military try to explain to the curious that food
will be distributed to people just in different location
some marines feel sorry not to be able to distribute the supplies themselves
but there are reasons behind this order
if give woman bottle of water and guy shows up and hits her can
engage him or detain him argues corporal nicolas hefley don have the
right to
un truck appears at about am speaking broken english blue helmets
from sri lanka try to understand why they have to begin their distribution with
water purification tablets
people here are poor not educated they don understand how to use this they
can read argues chief petty officer bandara nuwan galath of the sri lankan
navy who serves here as part of un stabilization force all they want is
food and water
but this attitude makes us gunnery sergeant joshua wruble veteran of three
tours of duty in afghanistan impatient
am telling you to take these tablets do you understand he snarls at the un
troops
the sergeant says he appreciates the opportunity to help haitians in need but
admits that humanitarian missions are not exactly his forte
you definitely have to transition your mindset he explains you have to take
it from one extreme to the other from combat thrill to compassion
wruble is no stranger to haiti he first came to the country in when then
us president bill clinton ordered us marines to land there to restore in power
president jean bertrand aristide toppled by military coup
we are here every three to four years he points out the haitian population
has an intimate knowledge of what the marines are about they respond well to
us
un troops finish distributing us relief supplies to nearby orphanage in the
afternoon once the mission is over few boxes remain in the back of the
truck these are water purification tablets
