football nations cup gate crashers zambia set sights on semis
lubango angola jan afp
star less zambia are the gate crashers at the africa cup of nations
quarter finals party in angola which finishes late on monday when they face
former champions nigeria at tundavala stadium
algeria cameroon ghana ivory coast and nigeria had to be present having
qualified for the world cup in south africa this year while hosts angola and
defending champions egypt were natural guest list choices
locked in four way struggle for two places with former winners cameroon and
tunisia and much improved gabon zambia were given little hope at home or abroad
of surviving the first round cull
but draw with tunisia narrow loss to cameroon and victory over gabon saw
chipolopolo copper bullets qualify as group winners on goals scored after
bizarre mini league within mini league that caused great confusion
so it was no surprise when year old french coach herve renard dashed down the
touchline to give leading zambian football official kalusha bwalya the mother of
all bear hugs after qualification was confirmed
bwalya skipper of the team beaten by nigeria in the final when the
countries last met displayed courage in choosing then unknown renard two years
ago after being tipped off by senior french coach claude le roy
renard was an assistant when le roy guided hosts ghana to third place at the
nations cup and holding egypt in cairo and finishing third at the african
nations championship last year have been highlights of his zambia tenure
with his pre tournament promise of last eight place fulfilled renard sees no
reason why his team cannot bridge year gap and clip the wings of the super
eagles
zambia triumphed in libya during before nigeria won semi final
eight years later and then the final in which zambia fielded virtual new team
after plane crash off gabon year before killed most of their stars
nigeria have strong and famous footballers but the pressure is on them not on
us we have nothing to lose and believe there is good chance we can beat
them boasted often media shy renard to reporters
my team has always been very talented technically gifted and know how to play
the game only to be let down by poor discipline and concentration at vital
moments that is where had problem but it is changing slowly
renard also praised the input of former african footballer of the year bwalya
who has played for captained and coached the national team and now heads the
national football association faz
we do exchange ideas and listen to his advice before making decisions
kalusha does not interfere because he knows you cannot be coach unless you
make decisions yourself
nigeria among six pre tournament title frontrunners were outclassed by egypt
and scraped past tiny neigbours benin before finally clicking to overwhelm
mozambique and finish group runners up
russia based wide midfielder cum striker osaze odemwingie scored twice to send
the mozambican mambas snakes packing and believes the and champions
can go all the way in angola and win the january climax
my goals have brought out our confidence now the belief is that we can go on
and lift the cup nigeria is great football nation and those who wear the
green and white must carry the responsibility that goes with it
nigeria fear no team we respect them all and expect them to respect us if you
study this tournament big teams have been upset but character and pedigree
brought them back into contention
while renard sleeps peacefully knowing his primary mission has been achieved
opposite number shaibu amodu faces another critical examination of his
credentials
despite only one competitive loss since taking over two years ago critics
demand his immediate dismissal and supporters within the nigerian football
hierarchy say semi finals place is the minimum requirement for survival

football africans warm to nations cup and fancy angola
johannesburg jan afp
south africa are shock absentees from the african cup of nations in angola
but interest in the competition remains high around the world cup host nation
pay channel supersport is screening all fixtures live while public
broadcaster sabc shows most long after they finished to the great annoyance of
football viewers
soap operas rule the roost at three channel sabc and even the south african
national team bafana bafana the boys often have to accept late kick offs to
fit programme schedules
supersport have provided minute build up to each game hired three time
african footballer of the year abedi pele as an analyst and allow their
continent wide audience to air views soon after full time
johannesburg newspapers did not send reporters to the three week tournament but
there is large daily dose of news agency copy in all titles to satisfy even
the most avid african football follower
business day title with little appetite for african football few years ago
led their main sports page with report and picture of the thrilling climax to
group that saw zambia and cameroon squeeze through
where south africans differ from most of africa is the likely outcome with
current star steven pienaar and nations cup winning midfielder innocent
buthelezi backing angola rather than ivory coast for the title
everton midfielder pienaar the slightly built star on whom so much will hinge
come june and the opening world cup fixture against mexico told the sowetan
angola can become the second nations cup champions from the region
angola have been the most impressive team since the tournament started working
as unit with an incredible appetite for goals choose them to emulate
champions bafana bafana
buthelezi who created international headlines for an old trafford tackle on
paul gascoigne that led to the england midfielder being carried off during
friendly backs pienaar
most matches are won or lost in midfield and this is where angola are so
powerful they are aggressive creative agile and communicate well year
old johannesburg company owner buthelezi told afp
am most impressed with how positive angola have been and they just need to
avoid the common african football pitfall of losing concentration in the closing
minutes as happened against mali when they gave away four goals
buthelezi said ivory coast captain didier drogba fellow striker flavio amado of
angola and nigeria midfielder john obi mikel were individuals who caught his
eye
being former midfielder really enjoy mikel he has an arrogance on the ball
and lack of respect for opponents that appreciate never respected opponents
how can you respect the enemy
multi award winning football analyst matshelane mamabolo of the johannesburg
star said the number of early upsets in the tournament caught him by surprise
but believes title holders egypt remain the team to beat
the pharaohs lack so many stars like mohamed aboutraika mohamed barakat
ahmed mido hossam and amr zaki fall behind to nigeria in their opening match
and still cruise to victory that is the stamp of great team
also believe ghana will benefit lot from the nations cup with so many
first choices injured they are blooding stars of the youth team that won the
world championship last year and this could pay off come the world cup
south africa were eliminated in the second of three qualifying rounds for
angola finishing second behind nigeria in one of four groups where the runners
up did not make the cut
democratic republic of congo morocco and world cup quarter finalists
senegal were other notable omissions from the line up for the biennial african
football showpiece

tennis nadal sets up blockbuster murray quarter final
melbourne jan afp
defending champion rafael nadal set up blockbuster australian open quarter
final against andy murray on sunday but the tournament ended for third seed
svetlana kuznetsova
zheng jie meanwhile rewrote the history books by becoming the first chinese
player to reach the last eight in melbourne
spain second seeded nadal was put through his paces by big serving croat ivo
karlovic who slammed down aces before he muted the challenge
it ensured an enticing last eight showdown with in form fifth seed murray after
the scot tamed another big server american john isner
murray is one of the more dangerous players on the tour he can play
aggressively and defensively said nadal who has not won tournament in eight
months after being hampered by injury last season
will have to play as well as can and use my forehand
murray will be competing in his first australian quarter final and is the first
briton since john lloyd in to get this far
he showcased his exciting strokeplay against isner and has yet to drop set in
his four victories at the year opening grand slam
playing well no question about that said murray who lost to nadal in
five sets in the fourth round of the australian open
just need to play like have been and maybe bit more if want to win the
tournament
ve been moving pretty well and played some great shots out there so
haven got much to complain about so far
the pair have played each other nine times with nadal winning seven
kuznetsova was knocked out by compatriot nadia petrova as the th seed
continued her giantkilling ways having already ousted kim clijsters
petrova matched her best performance in melbourne by winning and
will now play either belgians justine henin or yanina wickmayer for place in
the semi finals
it very disappointing because thought played very well in preparation
said kuznetsova
was struggling little bit was not good today think deserved to
lose
zheng achievement was impressive with the unseeded year old upsetting
ukrainian st seed alona bondarenko as as she and li na who
plays her fourth round match on monday continue to fly the flag for china
the victory sets her up with crack at either second seed dinara safina or
fellow russian maria kirilenko who play later sunday
zheng proved to be marginally steadier than the ukrainian in match where both
women struggled to hold their serves
think australia is lucky for me because won my first grand slam doubles
title in australia with yan zi zheng said
also so happy in the quarter finals
but think we can go further because you can see li na in the fourth round
hope both chinese players can be in the semi finals
seventh seed andy roddick will aim to join murray and nadal in the quarters when
he takes on chilean th seed fernando gonzalez in an evening match
the prize will be showdown with us open champion juan martin del potro or th
seeded marin cilic of croatia

answers winning in four sets

he can play aggressively and he can play defensively have to play as well as
can and use my forehand
coming off injury problems that blighted his nadal said he was pleased to
be in such good form at the start of the new year
being in the quarter finals is good result for me he said
it gives me lot of confidence
despite the th ranked karlovic booming serve nadal made it three wins from
as many meetings with the croatian by claiming three crucial service breaks in
the match
the first came in the ninth game of the opening set and allowed nadal to easily
serve out the set although karlovic claimed the second set by breaking nadal to
love in the th game
brilliant forehand pass by nadal gave him an early break in the third set that
he held onto while karlovic double fault in the corresponding game in the
fourth set handed the spaniard another break
boosted by his swag of aces karlovic actually hit winners while nadal
managed

points cheaply making just unforced errors compared to the croatian
