british irish leaders race to rescue ireland power sharing
belfast jan afp
the british and irish prime ministers made an unscheduled dash to northern
ireland monday and engaged in emergency talks with the province feuding
leaders in bid to save their faltering administration
prime minister gordon brown and his irish counterpart brian cowen headed for the
province after meeting in london as efforts stalled again to reach agreement
on policing between the parties who share power in northern ireland
we believe that the problems that exist in devolving policing and justice are
soluble problems mr brown said before heading for northern ireland
we believe it is right for northern ireland to move forward in this way and we
believe that together we can assist in the completion of these talks
the two governments were meeting both sides in the row at hillsborough castle
in county down
negotiations between the nationalist catholic sinn fein and pro british
democratic unionists dup over the transfer of police and justice powers from
london to their joint government are the final part of the devolution process
but the controversial issue has driven wedge between the parties and sinn
fein has warned that it could pull out of the government altogether unless
progress is made
there are now fears the power sharing administration may collapse bringing to
an end set up that helped end three decades of violence between catholic
republican opponents of british rule and protestant unionists who supported it
the high profile dash by brown and cowen was showing little progress late
monday and the british government said the leaders would stay overnight
gordon brown is staying overnight the talks are going well and in the right
spirit said government spokesman
the sense of crisis has been heightened by sex and funding scandal involving
the wife of first minister peter robinson who had an affair with year old
whom she helped financially triggering police investigation
robinson the leader of the dup has stood aside temporarily as first minister
vowing to clear his own name but remains engaged with the devolution talks
after the london meeting brown and cowen whose governments facilitated the
power sharing agreement expressed hope that deal could be done
we re going to belfast to see where we can assist this process we believe it
very important that we get successful outcome to these discussions cowen
told reporters ahead of the visit
sinn fein called an emergency meeting in belfast monday between its deputy first
minister martin mcguinness the dup robinson to address the lack of
agreement
at the weekend sinn fein chief gerry adams described the meeting as critical
and suggested his party could walk away from the power sharing process unless
deal was made
he has accused the dup of derailing the talks by demanding concessions on
policing controversial protestant orange order parades however robinson has
insisted progress is being made
the sectarian violence in northern ireland was largely ended by the good
friday agreement and all the main paramilitary groups from both sides have now
disarmed although some dissident groups remain active
most recently policeman lost leg in car bomb attack earlier this month
two men aged and were arrested over his attempted murder on monday

afghan taliban claims it targeted bulgarian defence minister
sofia jan afp
bulgarian defence minister nikolay mladenov denied on monday claims by the
afghan taliban that he was the main target in rocket attack on kandahar
airport last weekend
in statement released by the us based monitoring group site intelligence and
other islamist forums the militant movement said mladenov had been the main
target of its rocket strike on kandahar airport on january
it said that six rockets fell inside the airport and one fell metres
yards from the minister location site added
four bulgarian troops were wounded in the attack sunday on their base in the
southern city airport during visit by mladenov who was unharmed the defence
ministry in sofia said
upon his return from afghanistan late monday mladenov however denied the
information that he had been the target
find this claim absurd because the information published on the afghan
taliban website does not correspond with the truth there were not six rockets
fired at the base but just one mladenov told the state bnt television in an
interview
he added that the millimeter rocket was unguided which meant that it was
fired at the base but struck at random
this information should not be taken seriously mladenov added explaining
that risks exist and cannot be ruled out at any time
asked whether more discretion should have prevailed during his five day visit
mladenov said that all necessary measures for maximum security were taken
the minister arrived on an unannounced visit to kabul on wednesday but news of
his talks in the afghanistan capital and planned visit to the bulgarian troops
at kandahar air field spread through number of correspondents of local media
travelling with him
bulgaria has around troops in the nato led isaf military force in
afghanistan to help the government fight an insurgency led by taliban islamists
the bulgarians are currently stationed at kandahar air field and around the
airport in kabul but bulgaria is seeking to bring them together at single
location in order to cut costs and ease logistics
nba crittenton gets probation for guilty plea on gun charge
washington jan afp
washington wizards guard javaris crittenton was sentenced to one year of
probation and fined dollars after pleading guilty on monday to
misdemeanour gun possession charge in plea agreement
the charge came in connection with locker room incident last month involving
nba teammate gilbert arenas who faces sentencing next month after pleading
guilty to felony weapons charge
district of columbia superior court judge bruce beaudin passed the sentence on
crittenton year old nba reserve after prosecutors dropped second
misdemeanour charge and suggested only probation in exchange for guilty plea
crittenton also ordered to do haiti aid and youth community service work had
been charged with unlawful firearm possession and attempting to carry pistol
without license which each could have brought one year in jail
mr crittenton who was years old at the time of this incident has never
before been arrested or charged with any crime and with today misdemeanor plea
to possession of an unregistered firearm accepts responsibility for his
conduct said peter white crittenton attorney
he looks forward to explaining his actions to the nba and returning to the
basketball court as soon as possible
crittenton also surrendered his firearm to authorities
we commend mr crittenton for accepting responsibility and hope he fully
appreciates the gravity of his actions us attorney channing phillips said
the move comes days after arenas pleaded guilty to felony gun charge in
plea deal arenas was indefinitely suspended by the nba and will be sentenced
march
prosecutors agreed not to seek more than six months in jail for arenas in
exchange for his guilty plea
the charges stem from december locker room incident involving arenas that
was rooted in dispute over gambling debts during an airplane flight in which
crittenton and arenas joked about how they would attack each other crittenton
saying he would shoot arenas in the knees
two days later arenas brought four guns into team the locker room and put
them on chair near crittenton locker with note saying pick one in what
he later called joke
prosecutors said crittenton told arenas he did not need any of his guns and then
brandished one of his own
mr crittenton brought lawfully owned unloaded handgun into washington only
because he legitimately feared for his life white said in his statement
the government proffer of facts acknowledges that his handgun was not loaded
and that he never threatened anyone with it
the gun was legally purchased but bringing it into the district even for self
defence violated the city strict gun control laws
crittenton who has not played this season because of injuries is set to become
free agent after the season
us partners must team up on bank rules lawmaker
washington jan afp
top us lawmaker said monday he would attend this week world economic forum
in davos to press regulators from other major economic powers on common
strategy for reining in bank excesses
democratic representative barney frank chairman of the house financial services
committee said he would make the case to coordinate our efforts to update and
modernize financial regulations
my major goal this week is to further our efforts at cooperation and work to
prevent any national regulatory approaches that allow companies to dodge the
kind of accountability and responsibility that is needed said frank
excessive risk taking by the banking industry has been cited as one of the
causes of the recent financial and economic crisis and regulators have been
tasked by top politicians to draw up new rules to rein the banks in
proponents would find an ally in us president barack obama who announced plans
on thursday to prevent banks or financial firms in the united states from
owning investing in or sponsoring hedge fund or private equity funds
the new rules would force firms to choose between activities such as trading in
stocks and sometimes risky financial instruments for their own benefit and
traditional activities like making loans and collecting deposits
in the us congress obama republican foes have warned that imposing us rules
will drive banking business abroad and hurt us institutions in favor of their
overseas competitors
believe this is wrong said frank who added that he and other us officials
had been working to avoid such an outcome and that obama had put high
priority on coordinating with major economies
combined with our coordination efforts with the european union united kingdom
japan canada and other major economic powers am confident we can create
situation in which we can impose appropriate tough regulation without fear of
loss of business to or destabilizing effect from nations that will not join
us said frank

scott marcouiller at wells fargo advisors
the mood was tempered by news that sales of us existing homes fell more than
expected in december by nearly percent following three month surge driven
by government tax credit
joel naroff at naroff economic advisors said the report was not unexpected but
still showed the economy and the housing market remain fragile
this report also makes it clear that while housing may be out of intensive
care it is not yet ready to leave the hospital he said there is no need to
panic but thoughts of strong economic recovery should be tabled for while
fred dickson market strategist at da davidson amp co the market will be
keying on the central bank federal open market committe two day meeting
opening tuesday along with the outlook for bernanke confirmation
with his term technically expiring at the end of the month the question of who
will lead the fed becomes quiet issue overhanging this fomc meeting he said
although political forecasting is not our forte it appears that the senate
will confirm dr bernanke appointment by slim margin we would expect
positive market reaction when that becomes apparent
