yemen risks rights abuses in qaeda crackdown amnesty
london jan afp
yemen is risking rights abuses in its crackdown on an al qaeda militants linked
to the botched christmas day bombing of us airliner amnesty international
said on monday
the fear is that international demands for crackdown on suspected supporters
of al qaeda will be interpreted by the government as green light to crush all
opposition with no consideration for human rights malcolm smart the london
based watchdog middle east director said in statement
amnesty issued the statement ahead of an international conference in london on
wednesday on extremism social and economic issues in the poorest arab state in
the arabian peninsula
it said there was an increase in human rights violations against those who
criticise or oppose the government as part of its crackdown on the al qaeda
franchise al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap
aqap is thought to have trained the year old nigerian man who is accused of
trying to blow up the american airliner on approach to detroit on december
the government has resorted to increasingly repressive methods to counter this
opposition including waves of arrests incommunicado detention and unlawful
killings said smart
counter terrorism is no excuse to sideline human rights whilst the government
has duty to protect people and hold to account those engaged in terrorism it
must abide by its obligations under international law

an achille emana corner at the near post as it sailed into the net

emad motaeb who raced past onrushing goalkeeper kameni but his header was too
long for him to control and slot into an empty net

caught kameni napping with dipping shot from over yards which bounced in
front of the cameroon goalkeeper before resting at the back of the net to draw

britain welcomes new dalai lama talks with china
london jan afp
britain welcomed monday the resumption of talks between china and the dalai
lama expressing hope that progress could be made towards meaningful autonomy
for tibet
representatives of tibet exiled spiritual leader will resume talks on the
himalayan region autonomy on tuesday his office said
britain junior foreign office minister ivan lewis who made the first ever
trip to tibet by british government member in september welcomed the news
urge both sides to enter these talks in good faith and to make progress
towards meaningful autonomy for tibet lewis said
peaceful dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama
representatives is the only way to bring about lasting and peaceful solution
to the problems in tibet
made this clear during my own visit to tibet and beijing last year
the last round of talks collapsed months ago with beijing saying no progress
had been made and insisting it would not compromise on the status of tibet as an
integral part of china
china has often repeated demands that the tibetan leader renounce separatist
activities which he denies supporting
the dalai lama has sought meaningful autonomy for tibet since he fled his
homeland following failed uprising in against chinese rule nine years
after chinese troops invaded the region
china says the dalai lama is really seeking full independence for the territory
rugby union borthwick retains england captaincy
london jan afp
steve borthwick will retain the england captaincy for the upcoming six nations
championship opener against wales the rugby football union announced monday
earlier this month england manager martin johnson named his squad for the six
nations but refused to say if saracens lock borthwick would continue as captain
raising the possibility of new second row combination taking the field against
wales at twickenham next month
but an rfu statement monday said england team manager martin johnson has
confirmed steve borthwick saracens will captain the team
borthwick has captained england in every test that johnson himself former
lock has been in charge of since the world cup winning captain became manager
in
however their record as manager and captain of six wins from tests with
eight defeats has led to questions being asked of both men suitability for
their respective roles
many observers have also repeatedly queried whether borthwick is worth place
in the side purely as lock but monday announcement means that barring
injury the year old is set to retain the captaincy for the whole of the six
nations
johnson decision was announced after england arrived monday in portugal for

three blasts targeting baghdad hotels kill at least
baghdad jan afp
three huge and apparently co ordinated minibus bombs targeted hotels in baghdad
on monday killing at least people and wounding less than six weeks before
general election
iraqi politicians and us forces have warned of rising violence ahead of the
march vote the second parliamentary ballot since the us led invasion
ousted saddam hussein but ushered in deadly and long lasting insurgency
us secretary of state hillary clinton said extremists were trying to upend
progress toward democracy while un chief ban ki moon urged iraqis to remain on
path to reconciliation despite persistent unrest that plagues the country
the first bomb struck near the palestine and sheraton hotels in abu nawaz close
to where giant statue of saddam was symbolically toppled almost seven years
ago at around pm gmt
the second and third blasts just minutes later targeted the babylon hotel in the
central district of karrada and the hamra hotel in jadriyah in the south of the
capital said an interior ministry official who also gave the toll
iraqi military spokesman in baghdad major general qassim atta said all three
bombings were suicide attacks
the streets leading to the hotels were immediately sealed off preventing
journalists from approaching
security source said armed clashes broke out near the hamra in what appeared
to be diversionary attack before the suicide bomber drove his minibus at the
hotel seconds later and detonated it
the first explosion in abu nawaz shook ground miles away from the site of the
blast and sent plumes of smoke rising hundreds of metres yards into the sky
monday attacks differed from recent high profile bombings in baghdad in that
they targeted hotels one of the capital few remaining symbols of tourism
rather than government buildings
the hotel bombings were followed around minutes later by government
announcement that saddam notorious cousin and henchman chemical ali hassan
al majid symbol of the fallen regime had been executed
nearly people were killed and more than were wounded last year in co
ordinated vehicle bombings at government buildings including the ministries of
finance foreign affairs and justice in august october and december
the latest attacks occurred less than two weeks after security forces sealed off
baghdad after being tipped off that bomb laden cars had been parked in the city
insurgents weakened in the past year have in the past six months changed
tactics and mounted successful attacks on hard targets such as government
offices rather than so called soft targets in civilian areas
there are widespread fears in the wake of the bloody attacks to hit baghdad in
the second half of that political violence will rise in the weeks leading
up to the march vote
the election is seen as crucial step towards consolidating iraq democracy
and securing complete us military exit by the end of as planned
however bitter row has broken out in recent weeks after hundreds of candidates
were banned from taking part because of their alleged links with saddam which
could see sunnis marginalised from the political process
the dispute has alarmed the united states and the latest bombings will add to
washington concerns
when people believe in the political system and that they can chart their own
future then that poses direct rebuke to those who try to govern by fear
intimidation and violence clinton told reporters on monday
we unfortunately believe that there will be continued efforts by the terrorists
by al qaeda in iraq in particular to try to upend the commitment of the
iraqi people toward democratic future
the iraqis themselves by their actions are demonstrating great deal of
courage
us vice president joe biden made hour visit to baghdad at the weekend after
which he said he was confident iraq leaders would find just solution to
the exclusions issue
he did however say the united states supported the exclusion of candidates
linked to saddam outlawed baath party and military and intelligence services
the issue is not the goal of holding individuals accountable for their past
actions but the process of disqualification itself he said urging legitimate
procedures to safeguard the election credibility
