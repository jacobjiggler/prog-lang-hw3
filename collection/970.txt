london jan afp
matt stevens currently in the middle of two years drugs ban from rugby union
is to join saracens in january when his suspension expires the english
premiership side announced monday
england prop stevens was banned last year from all rugby after testing positive
for cocaine while player with sarries premiership rivals bath
statement issued monday by saracens said the year old would join the club
on january upon completion of his two year period of ineligibility
it added he will not train with the saracens squad or be integrated within the
club in any way until his ban has expired
brendan venter saracens director of rugby said this is massively
significant signing for the club it demonstrates the scale of our ambition
and it also shows that top players recognise saracens as well run club with
bright future
matt is world class prop with his best rugby ahead of him and sure he
will flourish in our environment the former springbok said of saracens
decision to sign the south africa born front row
stevens capped times by england since and member of the british
and irish lions squad that toured new zealand added am looking forward to
launching the next phase of my rugby career at saracens in january next year
have many great memories and friends in bath but there is something special
happening at saracens and am very eager to be part of it
stevens resigned from bath in march last year quitting four year deal with
the west country club worth reported one million pounds
since being suspended stevens has opened coffee shop in bath in partnership
with former bath and england colleague lee mears
saracens are currently in contention for the premiership title having become
resurgent force in english rugby this season under venter
stevens was banned after testing positive for cocaine following bath european
cup clash with glasgow in december
but his projected return with saracens still gives him an outside chance of
representing england at the world cup in new zealand
not long after he quit bath stevens told bbc radio hope with every grain of
my soul that one day will be able to come back and be better rugby player
than was

new us initiative to restart peace talks palestinians
ramallah west bank jan afp
the united states has proposed new initiative to nudge palestinians back into
peace talks with israel palestinian official told afp on monday
the new plan calls on israel to loosen its hold on some palestinian controlled
areas release number of prisoners and ease virtual blockade of the gaza
strip the official said
the initiative was aimed at creating an atmosphere for the relaunching of
peace talks suspended more than year ago the official said on condition of
anonymity
he said it was presented by us middle east envoy george mitchell who met
palestinian and israeli leaders last week
mitchell plan calls on israel to cease military operations in so called area
of the occupied west bank which is under full palestinian control and pull
back from some parts of area which is under palestinian civil control the
official said
it would also allow palestinian security forces to enter area which is under
complete israeli military control and would free number of palestinian
prisoners he added
he said that under the plan israel would ease sanctions on the hamas ruled
gaza strip allowing rebuilding of the territory which was devastated during
massive israeli offensive in december and january
israel would also be bound to transfer customs duties it collects on behalf of
the palestinians to the palestinian authority on monthly basis the official
said
he said that israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu had requested meeting
with palestinian president mahmud abbas to discuss the initiative ahead of
formal announcement
but abbas insisted that israel implement the ideas first before any talks
considering that these are israeli obligations we will consider them goodwill
gestures the official said
senior israeli official told afp that the united states had suggested
discussions take place initially at the level of teams working on different
subjects before proposing confidence building measures
such strategy would pave the way for normal discussions to resume the
official added without elaborating
abbas has not dropped his demand that israel halt all settlement growth in the
occupied west bank and mostly arab east jerusalem ahead of any talks or his
insistance on framework of guidelines for the negotiations
mitchell suggested indirect talks with us mediation to thrash out the main
points of the latest initiative and the two palestinian demands the official
said
he was speaking day after mitchell held second round of meetings with
netanyahu in jerusalem and with abbas in amman
netanyahu said after the meeting that mitchell had presented new ideas but did
not elaborate on them

obama aide seeks greater pakistan action
washington jan afp
president barack obama national security adviser on monday called for pakistan
to see greater urgency in the fight against extremism and pledged that
washington was committed for the long haul
retired general james jones said that the role of pakistan was critical for the
future of the region where the united states is pouring thousands more troops
into afghanistan to fight al qaeda and taliban extremists
it is beyond question that the speed with which we re able to achieve our goals
in afghanistan has relationship to the willingness of pakistan to take on the
fact that safe havens exist in the border region jones said at the center for
american progress think tank
jones said the obama administration would make sure we do everything we can to
convince them of the urgency of the moment not just for afghanistan but
for pakistan and the region itself
us officials have long been concerned that elements in the pakistani
establishment support extremists despite the nation offensives against
talbian strongholds in its lawless border areas
jones paid quiet visit to islamabad in november in which he was widely
reported to be disappointed about pakistani leaders commitment to targeting al
qaeda extremists on their soil
but jones said that the united states understood pakistani concerns and sought
longer term relationship pointing to giant new us aid package aimed at
boosting infrastructure and democratic institutions
we are entering new strategic relationship jones said in which the united
states is not just interested in short term relationship but long term
relationship that will affect beneficially the future of pakistan as democracy
in areas far beyond security
defense secretary robert gates visited islamabad last week where he said that
that the united states committed mistake by lowering ties with pakistan after
the two countries worked to drive the soviets out of afghanistan in the

dubai jan afp
the afghan taliban claimed on monday that it was behind sunday rocket attack
on kandahar airport saying that bulgarian defence minister nicolay mladenov was
the main target site intelligence said in statement posted on its
website and other islamist forums the militant movement said mladenov was the
main target of its rocket strike on kandahar airport on january the us
based monitoring group said
it said that six rockets fell inside the airport and one fell metres
yards from the minister location site added
four bulgarian troops were wounded in the rocket attack at their base in the
southern city airport during visit by mladenov who was unharmed the defence
ministry in sofia said
bulgaria has around troops in nato led military force from nearly

exercise regularly age better studies
washington jan afp
taking regular exercise helps you to stay physically healthier and mentally
sharper into old age four studies published in the archives of internal
medicine showed monday
one of the studies found that women who exercised more during middle age
defined as an average age of by researchers at the harvard school of public
health brigham and women hospital and harvard medical school were less
likely after to develop chronic diseases heart surgery or any physical
cognitive or mental impairments
another study found that year of resistance training once or twice week
improved older women attention spans and conflict resolution skills
third found that adults aged and older who engaged in moderate or high
physical activity were less likely to become cognitively impaired than their
couch potato equivalents
and women aged or older who took part in an exercise program for months
appeared to have denser bones and reduced risk of falls than women the same
age who followed less intense wellness program fourth study showed
the findings of the studies which were conducted in canada germany and the
united states could be just what the doctor ordered to get more americans to
exercise the authors of the first study said
since the american population is aging rapidly and nearly quarter of
americans do not engage in any leisure time activity our findings appear to
support federal guidelines regarding physical activity to promote health among
older people and further emphasize the potential of activity to enhance overall
health and well being with aging the authors of that study said
the notion that physical activity can promote successful survival rather than
simply extend the lifespan may provide particularly strong motivation for
initiating activity they said
france seeks tougher eu sanctions against iran
brussels jan afp
france on monday urged its european union partners to prepare new sanctions
against iran saying they were now required due to tehran intransigence over
its nuclear programme
the europeans have to prepare the sanctions process european affairs minister
pierre lellouche told reporters after meeting with his eu counterparts in
brussels
he said sanctions were needed because of iran refusal of all offers of
solution made by the west
we have been in talks for six years lellouche sighed all the west
proposals have been rejected and now if we listen to the iranian spokesman they
are reaching percent enrichment of uranium in iran which is the threshold
to militarisation he added
we hope europeans will work together on preparing the sanctions he
underlined
three sets of united nations security council sanctions have already been
imposed on iran over its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment which lies at
the heart of international fears about the nature of its nuclear programme
the eu britain china france germany russia and the united states
met in new york earlier this month but failed to reach an agreement about new
sanctions
europe and the west are concerned about tehran rejection of un brokered deal
under which most of iran low enriched uranium leu stockpile would be shipped
abroad to be further enriched into reactor fuel
tehran ignored us set december deadline to accept that offer drawn up by
the un international atomic energy agency and countered with its own proposal
of simultaneous and staged swap of leu with reactor fuel
europe and washington fear that iran is secretly developing fissile material for
nuclear weapons under the cover of its uranium enrichment programme
but oil rich iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful and solely geared
toward generating electricity for its civilian population
nevertheless lellouche accepted that without un sanctions which involve getting
china and russia on board there would be no unilateral measures from europe
if there is no agreement in the un security council there won be any
sanctions he stressed
not all eu nations are keen on the idea of going ahead now with preparations for
further sanctions against tehran
the sanction instrument is very blunt one so it should be used with extreme
care our aim is to get the iranians to the negociating table and have
politicial solution said swedish foreign minister carl bildt
