brussels jan afp
the european commission said monday it had backed state aid offered by britain
to banks bradford amp bingley and dunfermline ending its last two probes into
assistance offered as part of london bank restructuring

taken on dunfermline is closing the chapter of uk bank restructuring prompted
by state aid in the context of the financial crisis european commission
statement said
bradford amp bingley was split up with impaired assets nationalised in
under liquidation plan
the commission has authorised the measures because they are appropriate and
necessary for an orderly winding down of the bank while taking into account the
necessity to preserve the confidence of creditors in the financial system and
remedy serious disturbance of the uk economy the commission said
spanish banking giant santander bought part of the assets of bradford amp
bingley for million pounds in september
in the case of dunfermline smaller building society mainly operating in
scotland the part considered good was sold in an auction to competitor
nationwide with state financial contribution of some billion pounds
billion euros or billion dollars and the remainder put into administration
the commission found that the orderly break up of dunfermline resulted in the
return to viability of the good part and that the liquidation of
substantial part of dunfermline limited the distortion of competition caused by
the aid separate statement added
building societies or mutuals are owned by their members and are not listed on
the stock exchange they also specialise in home loans

which was taken into public ownership

country biggest institutions including royal bank of scotland percent
owned by the state and lloyds banking group in which london has percent
holding
last month britain slapped percent tax rate on bank employee bonuses above
pounds to recoup some of the cash spent rescuing the financial sector

tennis davydenko takes five set route to quarters
melbourne jan afp
nikolay davydenko smooth run at the australian open struck some road bumps
monday and he needed five sets to douse spaniard fernando verdasco and advance
to the quarter finals
the russian sixth seed bungled fourth set tiebreaker and was forced into
winner take all fifth set before prevailing over the ninth seeded verdasco
in almost four hours
in form davydenko improved his winning streak to matches and he will take on
roger federer in wednesday quarters after the swiss top seed outclassed
australian nd seed lleyton hewitt in straight sets
davydenko has beaten time grand slam champion federer at their last two
encounters although the world number one strung together the previous wins
the russian who now boasts record over verdasco was confident he would
be mentally stronger than the spaniard over the course of the long match
he strong physically but not mentally he said
for sure he can play five six sets but he can hold his concentration for
all five sets and he can make mistakes
mentally still strong don know if can win here but feeling
good about my tennis right now
it was great relief for the quirky russian who was known as the ice man
before becoming one of the hottest players on the men tour with his run of
form against the top stars
it was not so easy for me beginning the fifth set but it good fighting win
for me he said
it was four hours and won some good points and played well in the fifth
set
leading into his first match on the rod laver arena davydenko had dropped just
games in straight set victories in his three previous rounds
he looked like he would have few problems with the misfiring verdasco claiming
the opening two sets before he was hauled into dogfight as the left hander
surged back taking the third set and the fourth set in fluctuating
tiebreaker
davydenko worked his way to in the tiebreaker with two serves to come but
imploded with backhand and forehand errors for verdasco to claim send the match
into fifth set
played the tiebreak really bad davydenko said because and my two
serve to come it was so disappointing just sitting down after fourth set and
thinking what need to do now
the deflated russian recovered his composure to break verdasco in the sixth game
to power to victory
he broke verdasco erratic serve seven times and gave up his serve four times
it will be davydenko th grand slam quarter final and fourth in six years at
the australian open but he has yet to progress past the semi final stage in
grand slams
it was again more misery for verdasco who served double faults among his
unforced errors
at the beginning of the fifth set he looked more tired than any time in the
match verdasco said
but he really stayed there in the fifth set even though he was looking more
tired than usual and making more mistakes
last year verdasco reached his only grand slam semi final here losing in five
sets to eventual champion rafael nadal in five hours minutes the longest
ever men match at the australian open
